// reasonable running total and day-by-day trend for the admin-only
// dashboard below. No cookies, no per-visitor identity involved -- just a
// running count of events.
// Calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD) for a given moment, in Eastern time -- this
// admin dashboard is for a single owner in a fixed timezone, and using
// UTC's day boundary meant "today" started rolling over into "tomorrow"
// as early as ~7-8pm Eastern, well before the day was actually over
// locally. en-CA formats as YYYY-MM-DD directly; America/New_York's IANA
// data handles the EST/EDT switch automatically, unlike a fixed offset
// would.

// --- Counter storage ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every counter here used to be a KV read-modify-write: GET, add one, PUT.
// KV has no atomic increment and no compare-and-swap, so two overlapping
// requests both read the same number and both write the same number+1, and
// one is silently lost. Measured against this Worker: twenty concurrent
// requests recorded as ONE.
//
// Production is worse than that measurement, in two ways that compound with
// traffic: KV reads are edge-cached, so every request inside a cache window
// can read the same stale value; and KV allows roughly one write per second
// per key, which the hot keys (stats:pageviews:total and each day bucket)
// are. The dashboard therefore drifts further from reality the busier the
// deployment gets -- downward, silently, while still rendering a confident,
// precise-looking number.
//
// SQLite's upsert is atomic and removes the class outright. This is the same
// shape the source_groups counter has always used (see bumpStatBy below) --
// every other counter now works the way that one already did.
//
// D1 stays OPTIONAL, exactly as it is everywhere else in this codebase: with
// no DB bound the KV path below runs unchanged, lost updates and all. That
// is a real remaining limitation for KV-only deployments, not an oversight
// -- KV genuinely cannot do this correctly, and the honest options there are
// to bind D1 or to read the numbers as approximate.
//
// Counters are the ONE data family where "D1 is optional and removable at any
// time without data loss" -- true of accounts, lists and likes, which are
// always written to KV -- does not hold. Once D1 is bound these write to D1
// alone, because dual-writing would put the lost-update race straight back in
// (and spend a second write per bump on a key KV rate-limits to one per
// second). So unbinding D1, or rebuilding it from schema.sql, rolls every
// counter back to the KV value it had at migration time. That trade is the
// right one and is now stated in wrangler.toml where an operator will see it,
// rather than being a surprise.

Safe to run more than once; it only adds, never resets anything. Processes accounts a few at a time, so it may take a minute for larger sites.</p>

      <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin:6px 0 0; font-size:0.8rem;">One-time migration for the switch from one KV key per day to one JSON blob per title -- reads every old per-day count still sitting in KV and folds it into the new format, so 7/30/90-day windows reflect activity from before that switch instead of only counting forward from it. Safe to run more than once (adds, never subtracts); old keys are deleted once folded in, so re-running just confirms there's nothing left. Also covers the Search &amp; Queries leaderboard.</p>

    <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin-top:0; font-size:0.9rem;">The <strong>New on Streaming</strong> catalog &mdash; what actually arrived on a streaming service, newest first, with a show pushed back to the top the day a new episode airs. It is a real catalog row right now and can be installed into Stremio or Nuvio from the URLs below; it is in the My Lists Addon Charts section of Quick Add and in Discover.</p>
    <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin:0 0 16px; font-size:0.82rem;">Powered by RapidAPI's <strong>Streaming Availability API</strong> (/changes) to capture the exact date titles and new episodes are added to streaming services (not release dates), with new arrivals first and recent episodes bumping shows to the top within a rolling 30-day window.</p>

      <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin:10px 0 0; font-size:0.8rem;">Each page fetches up to 25 changes from RapidAPI. Automated sweeps run every 6 hours via cron and read each change stream (new titles, new seasons, new episodes, removals) oldest-first from where the last sweep stopped, so a busy day is finished on the next run instead of being cut off. The per-run budget is the month&#39;s remaining quota spread over the runs left; a safety cap halts sweeps at 950 calls to ensure zero overages. "Run a sweep now" continues the same streams with the page count given. Older titles (&gt;30 days) are pruned automatically each sweep.</p>

    <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin-top:0; font-size:0.9rem;">The shared pool behind every <strong>Quick Add Popular Networks</strong> channel (up to 5,000 episodes per network, cached 24h under <code>channel:preset:v2:&lt;networkId&gt;</code>) &mdash; every visitor who Quick Adds the same network reads this same cache. A daily cron rotation keeps it warm automatically, but a cache built under an older version of the build code keeps serving its old shape until that rotation reaches it again, which can take a few hours. Clear or rebuild a network here to skip the wait.</p>

      <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin:0 0 10px; font-size:0.82rem;">Removes specific lists belonging to one Creator Profile: the list itself, its likes, its place in that creator&rsquo;s order, and its directory entry. Use it for content a creator cannot or will not remove themselves. A slug whose list is already gone is still cleared from the directory, which is how you get rid of an entry that shows an item count but opens empty.</p>
      <p style="color:#8E8E93; margin:0 0 10px; font-size:0.82rem;">Browse first: this reads the creator&rsquo;s actual stored records, including any the creator&rsquo;s own dashboard cannot see because they are missing from their display order &mdash; which is how an account ends up with dozens of copies of one list under slugs nobody could guess. Filter by name, select them all, then delete. Deleting also records the deletion on the account, so the creator&rsquo;s other signed-in browsers drop their copies instead of uploading them straight back.</p>
      <p style="color:#FF9500; margin:0 0 10px; font-size:0.82rem;"><strong>This cannot be undone.</strong> There is no backup of a deleted list. Prefer &ldquo;Rebuild Public List Index&rdquo; above first &mdash; if the lists are only phantom directory entries, that fixes them without deleting anything.</p>
