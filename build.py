# Python equivalent of build.ps1: header + numbered split files, byte-exact.
#
# The header used to be recovered by searching the EXISTING combined file for
# the current contents of 00_constants.js and keeping everything before it.
# That made the build self-referential: editing 00_constants.js broke the
# search, and the build then refused to run at all ("could not locate
# 00_constants.js inside the existing combined file"). It also meant the
# header had no source file, so a direct edit to it inside the generated
# Worker was invisible to the CI drift check. It now comes from header.js
# like every other input.

    # LF, not CRLF. This separator only fires for a source that does not end
    # with a newline, so it was a single stray CRLF in an otherwise-LF file --
    # invisible to verify.sh and CI (both ignore CR at EOL) but enough to make
    # check_sync.py's byte-exact compare fail on a clean checkout. See
    # .gitattributes.
