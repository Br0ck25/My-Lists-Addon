# Changelog

All notable changes to **My Lists Addon** ([mylistsaddon.com](https://mylistsaddon.com)) are documented in this file.

---

## [Unreleased]

### ⚠️ Deploy notes for this release (operator)

Do these in order. Details are in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.

1. **Back up D1**: Time Travel, or `npx wrangler d1 export my-lists-db --remote --output=backup.sql`.
2. **Apply `migrations/0014_add_schema_migrations.sql`, then `migrations/0015_accounts_sessions_installs.sql`**, in the D1 Console and in that order. Both only add tables and are safe to run twice. Nothing uses 0015's tables yet, but until it is applied the admin schema check lists it as missing.
3. **Add the Analytics Engine binding**: Worker → Settings → Bindings → Add → Analytics Engine, name `ANALYTICS`, dataset `mylists_events`.
4. **Paste and deploy** `worker_entry_combined.js`.
5. **Delete the retired variables** if they are set: `BULK_RESOLVE_SUBREQUEST_BUDGET`, `DETAILS_BATCH_SUBREQUEST_BUDGET`, `CRON_SUBREQUEST_BUDGET`. The code ignores them either way.

The new secrets `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `LOOKUP_PEPPER` are **not needed yet**: nothing in this release uses them. They will be needed when the Phase 3a sign-in and account-storage code ships, and the release notes will say so then.

### 🔒 Phase 3a: accounts, sessions, and authentication (P3a-1, P3a-2, P3a-3, P3a-4, P3a-5)

- **CSRF Protection Middleware (P3a-5)**:
  - Enforces same-origin validation (`Origin` header matching Worker origin or `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`) and `Content-Type: application/json` on all state-changing requests (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).
  - Blocks cross-origin mutating attempts and non-JSON payloads (such as `text/plain` beacon or simple form requests) with `403 Forbidden`.
  - Safely exempts webhook ingestion routes (`/api/scrobble*`), OAuth provider flow routes (`/api/*/oauth/*`), and admin HTML login/logout forms (`/admin/login`, `/admin/logout`).
  - Does not restrict safe methods (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`).

- **Sessions API and Authentication (P3a-4)**:
  - `POST /api/session`: Authenticates with username and Account Key (or legacy `creatorName`/`creatorKey`). Verifies PBKDF2 hash, automatically upgrades PBKDF2 iterations to target (`PBKDF2_ITERATIONS`) on login, and lazily backfills accounts from legacy D1/KV records if not yet migrated. Generates a crypto-random 256-bit token stored as SHA-256 hash in D1 `sessions`, and sets the `mla_session` cookie (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/; Max-Age=30d`).
  - `DELETE /api/session`: Revokes the current session in D1 and isolate cache, and clears the session cookie (`Max-Age=0`).
  - `GET /api/me`: Returns the authenticated account profile (`id`, `username`, `displayName`, `createdAt`, `lastActiveAt`, `version`, `status`) with strict `no-store` caching.
  - `GET /api/me/sessions`: Lists active devices/sessions for the current account, indicating the current device (`current: true`), creation time, last active time, expiration, and user agent.
  - `DELETE /api/me/sessions`: Device/session revocation endpoint supporting revoking all other sessions (`{ allExceptCurrent: true }` / `?other=1`), revoking a specific session by ID prefix (`{ id }`), or revoking all sessions across all devices.
  - **Session resolution middleware**: Resolves sessions via `mla_session` cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in `handleFetch`, sets `request.account` and `request.session`, and caches verified sessions in isolate memory for 60 seconds.


- **Accounts backfill job** (`backfillAccounts`, `reconcileAccounts` in `02_http-and-creator-utils.js`, `/admin/api/migrate-accounts` in `26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`):
  - Copies all identities from D1 `creators` and KV `creator:*` into the `accounts` table created in migration 0015.
  - Conflict resolution: newest `keyHash` wins; D1 wins ties.
  - Reconciliation check: verifies `count(accounts) = |creators ∪ creator:*|`.
  - Non-destructive: copies data only, never mutates or deletes old `creators` or `creator:*` records.
  - Safe and idempotent to run multiple times, preserving existing account `id`s.
  - Supports dry-run inspection via `reconcileAccounts` or `GET /admin/api/migrate-accounts`.
  - Admin maintenance tab adds a panel and button to run the accounts migration and display live reconciliation status.

- **Migration 0015** (`migrations/0015_accounts_sessions_installs.sql`) adds the tables `accounts`, `sessions`, `installs`, `provider_connections`, `install_secrets`, `rate_counters` and `account_settings`.
  - It is also in `schema.sql` and the admin schema check.
  - The required database version stays at 0014, so deploying before running 0015 does not pause anything.
- **Token encryption** (`encryptToken` / `decryptToken` in `02_http-and-creator-utils.js`):
  - AES-256-GCM with a random 12-byte IV, and support for rotating keys (`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, as `k1:<base64>,k0:<older>`).
  - An optional context argument binds a ciphertext to the row it belongs to (for example `account:42:trakt`), so a token copied into another row fails to decrypt.
- **Blind index** (`hmacLookupKey`): HMAC-SHA256 under `LOOKUP_PEPPER`, with the same key normalisation as the existing forgot-username lookup.
- Tests cover:
  - round trip and key rotation;
  - the wrong key, a tampered IV or ciphertext, and a missing or malformed key;
  - context binding.

### 🔒 Signed out, an install link carries the site's public lists only

Without an account you can still add any of the site's public lists to the Live Preview and generate an install link. The public lists are charts, Discover and curated shelves, storylines, community lists, and links to public MDBList, Trakt, TMDB or Letterboxd lists.

Everything personal or made by you now needs a free account:
- custom lists and imports;
- channels;
- your watchlist, watch history, Continue Watching and Airing Next;
- connecting a Trakt, MDBList, Simkl or TMDB account.

The site asks you to sign in when you start one of these, before you've done any work.

**Storylines and Explore Channels add like public lists.** "+ Add" on Storylines, Sagas & Universes and on an Explore Channels listing puts the channel in the Live Preview as a catalog row, for anyone. It no longer copies the channel into My Channels.

**Customizing needs an account.** Customize on a storyline, or Edit on a channel row, asks signed-out visitors to sign in when clicked. Before, the prompt only came at Save.

**Storyline Remove.** "+ Add" and "Remove" on a storyline card now find the row by the storyline's exact channel id. One storyline's id can be the start of another's, so a substring match could hit the wrong row.

**Server side.** `/api/save` refuses a signed-out configuration that has any of those rows (401 `signInRequired`), and it stores no provider keys, tokens or playback tracking for a signed-out save. A signed-in builder proves its account with the save; that proof is checked and never stored in the link.

**Install links never expire.** That holds signed in or out, however long a link goes unused (D-10).

**Existing install links keep working unchanged**, including ones with custom lists, channels or personal shelves. A signed-out builder that still has such rows shows them as before. To make a new link from it, sign in or remove those rows first; the site names them.

- Tests:
  - every personal row type is refused signed out, and every public one is accepted;
  - a signed-out save stores no credentials;
  - a signed-in save keeps them, without storing the proof;
  - an older link still serves its custom list;
  - the builder's check and the server's agree on 37 URL shapes, including storyline and Explore rows;
  - a signed-out Explore row is stored as its published lineup, and one whose code isn't listed is refused;
  - storyline and Explore rows stay out of My Channels;
  - Customize and Edit ask for an account before anything is loaded or copied;
  - the builder gates and `generate()` behave as described.
  - The server check and the builder gate were each switched off once to confirm their tests fail.

### 🔒 Likes, shares and the directory need an account

Only signed-in accounts can now:
- like a list, a provider list or chart, or a channel;
- share or publish a channel;
- count toward a channel's "added" total, once per account.

A signed-out tap on a heart or a Share button opens a "Sign in to …" prompt instead, and nothing is sent. The server refuses the same requests with 401 `signInRequired`, whatever the client does.

Lists published anonymously before accounts existed (`/lists/user/<slug>`) **still work at their URLs**, so installs that use them are unaffected. They no longer appear in the directory or search, and they can't be liked. An admin can still delete them from `/admin`. Channel share codes minted anonymously also keep opening for anyone who has them. Rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-6.

### 🔒 Security fixes

- **Logs can't carry a secret.** Every log line the Worker writes now goes through `redactForLog`. It masks:
  - key, token and session parameters in URLs (`api_key`, `access_token`, `token`, `key`, `code`, …);
  - `Bearer` tokens;
  - Creator Keys;
  - credential-named fields in logged objects.

  A module-level `console` at the top of `00_constants.js` does this, the same way the `fetch` guard works, so all ~120 existing log calls and any future ones are covered. A check on 2026-09-27 found no current log line writing a secret; this keeps it that way.
- **Every outbound call now has a timeout.** Most provider calls had none, so a provider that stopped answering held the request, or a cron sweep, until the platform gave up. The `fetch` guard in `02_` now gives any call without its own timeout a 30-second ceiling. The calls Stremio waits on keep their own 10 seconds. A test makes an upstream hang and checks the Worker still answers.
- **API responses are no longer cacheable unless the route says so.** `json()` used to mark every success as cacheable for an hour, so personal routes had to remember to opt out, and `/api/resolve` once didn't. Success is now `no-store` by default.
  - Public lookups (title and person search, show seasons and episodes, list search, the channel directory, published-list search) opt in with `jsonCacheable`.
  - The Stremio routes opt in through `jsonPublic`.
  - A probe of every route, plus a full test run with `json()` instrumented, confirmed the same public routes are still cached as before.

- **An install link no longer exposes the provider keys and tokens inside it.** Install links get pasted into apps and shared.
  - `/<id>/configure` used to write the link's TMDB, MDBList and Trakt keys and tokens into the page.
  - `/api/resolve`, which "Import from link" uses, returned the MDBList and Trakt ones. Importing someone else's link also connected you to *their* Trakt and MDBList accounts.
  - The builder doesn't need them since signed-out saves stopped storing keys. A signed-in save uses the account's own keys, which account sync restores on any device.
  - A new test probes every route the Worker answers with an install link's secrets in storage, and checks none are ever returned. It reads the route list from the source, so new routes are covered automatically.

- **A signed-in Trakt shelf could be served to another user from Cloudflare's edge cache.** A request that carries an `Authorization` header is now never edge-cached, whichever code path makes it. A test pins it; without the guard it fails on `calendars/my/shows`.
- **Private keys and tokens are no longer accepted in URLs**, where they end up in logs and browser history. `/api/preview`, `/api/tmdb-my-lists`, `/api/mdblist-my-lists`, `/api/simkl/my-lists`, `/api/quick-channel-shows` and `/api/feedback/threads` refuse them in the query string and take them in a POST body instead. The site already sends them that way.
- **TMDB sign-in is bound to the browser that started it.** The callback requires the request-token cookie, and a token in the URL has to match it.
- **Rate limiting fails closed.** A request with no client IP is refused rather than sharing one bucket. Every Creator Key check that isn't already memoised counts against the per-IP limit.
- The `?debug=1` output on the Trakt and MDBList sign-in routes was removed.
- `getCreator` no longer falls back to a fuzzy username match.

### ⚡ Workers Paid: the Free-plan budgets are gone

The hosted Worker runs on Workers Paid, so work that used to be split to fit the Free plan's 50 outbound fetches now finishes in one invocation:
- `/api/bulk-resolve` takes a whole 200-title Letterboxd import in one call.
- `/api/details/batch` resolves the whole Airing Next batch in one call (`done: true`, no resume).
- Each 6-minute cron tick warms every shared chart and runs the full episode, New on Streaming, Airing Next and poster sweeps.

The three `*_SUBREQUEST_BUDGET` variables are retired.

### 🗄️ The database knows its own version

- **Migration `0014` adds a `schema_migrations` ledger.** A Worker that needs a newer migration than the database has now refuses API writes with a 503 "My Lists is being updated" instead of writing a shape the database can't hold. Reads keep working. A database that predates the ledger is let through.
- **`schema.sql` is no longer destructive.** It used to begin with `DROP TABLE` for every table. It is now all `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS` and seeds the ledger.
- The search index no longer carries legacy anonymous lists, since search never returns them.
- `/admin` → Maintenance → **Check schema** shows the database's migration version and the version this Worker needs, and says plainly when writes are paused.

### 📈 Request metrics

With the `ANALYTICS` binding, every request writes one Analytics Engine data point: route family, method, status, duration, and its KV reads, writes and lists plus D1 statements and batches. Route families are grouped so install IDs don't each become a row. Without the binding nothing runs, and a failing dataset never affects a response.

### 🧹 Hosted only

- If the install link can't be saved, the site says "Could not create your install link just now" with a Try again button. It used to fall back to a self-contained base64 link that carried the whole configuration, and so any keys in it, in the URL.
- Install links are only accepted from mylistsaddon.com or the current origin.
- The cross-deployment `/api/resolve` proxy was removed.
- About 17 "the Worker owner needs to set X" messages now read "X is temporarily unavailable".
- The in-app guide's Self-Hosting section was removed, and the page title no longer says "Self-Hosted".

### ⚡ Catalog rows stop reading watch history they don't use

Every Stremio row request for an install with a personal shelf used to read and parse the owner's whole tracking record, which can be megabytes, even for a Trending row. A "Recommended" row read it three times.
- `resolveConfig` now reads the tracking record only when asked. Only the channel meta route and `/api/resolve` ask.
- The curated and auto-tracked rows use the owner the catalog route already passes, instead of resolving the install config a second time.
- Tests count the reads: none for a chart row, one for a curated row, and the install config read once per request.

### 🐛 Smaller fixes

- **Opening Configure no longer switches Better Posters off.** The configure page was never told an install's Better Posters settings, so it showed them off, and pressing Update saved them off. All install-link settings now come from one list, `INSTALL_CONFIG_FIELDS` in `00_constants.js`. It is used by `/api/save`, `resolveConfig`, `decodeConfig`, the configure page, and the builder's save body and signed-out filter; each of those used to keep its own hand-written copy, and the copies had drifted:
  - Configure left out Better Posters;
  - `simklUsername` was stored but never read back;
  - old base64 links read only one of the five badge toggles.

  A test round-trips every field in the list, so a field added later is covered automatically. Another checks the builder sends every one.

- **Faster TMDB-to-IMDb lookups.** `/api/imdb-ids` now resolves up to 100 posters per call (was 24), 8 at a time, so a whole See All page is one request.
- **No sleeping inside the Trakt PIN request.** When Trakt rate-limits `/api/trakt/device/code`, the Worker now hands the 429 and its `Retry-After` back instead of sleeping. The page waits it out and retries once on its own. The OAuth callback keeps its single 1.5 s pause, because it is a browser redirect with no page to retry it.
- **Admin leaderboards read their counters by key range.** They used `LIKE 'prefix%'`, which the `stats` table's `(kind, day)` primary key can't serve. The windowed leaderboard now looks up its prefix instead of reading every counter in the date window.
- **Leftover budget code removed:** the `meter` fetch counting and the Airing Next budget pool, which nothing used after the Free-plan budgets went.
- **The builder and `/api/save` share one list of personal shelves.** The page gets the server's list rendered into it, which adds the Simkl watchlist, history and Airing Next sentinels to the sign-in rule.
- **Daily encrypted D1 backup.** `.github/workflows/d1-backup.yml` exports the database each day. It stays off until its four repository secrets are set (`docs/OPERATIONS.md` §5).

- The "last good" copy of a catalog moved from KV to the Cache API, which takes it off KV's write budget.
- `attachEventMeta` queries D1 in chunks of 90 ids. It used to bind every id into one `IN (...)` query, which goes over D1's limit of 100 parameters on a long list, and the failure was swallowed silently.
- Badged posters carry the day in their URL, so a cached "airs tomorrow" badge doesn't outlive the day.
- Published-list catalog items with a bare numeric id now resolve to `tmdb:<id>`.
- Trakt OAuth retries are capped (one retry after 1.5 s), so a sign-in can't hang the request.

### 🧪 Tests

- The test D1 enforces D1's real limits: at most 100 bound parameters per statement and 2 MB per row.
- New suites cover sign-in-only likes and shares, the schema gate, request metrics, and credentialed requests never being edge-cached.
- Tests written for anonymous voting now vote through real accounts, one per test IP.
- The anime-unpacking tests used to pass any URL they hadn't stubbed to the real network. On a slow connection that meant a 10-second timeout and a failure. They now answer those URLs with a 404, so they never touch the network.
- The "like lands mid-save" test used to wait a fixed 20 ms. Signing a voter in can take longer than that, and then the test deadlocked on itself; it now waits for the like to actually reach the gate.

### ✨ Most Watched Today rolls over instead of going empty at midnight

"Today" was counted per Eastern day, so at midnight the list emptied and refilled one watch at a time. Now the list stays:
- Titles watched today go on top, most watched first.
- Everything else keeps its place below.
- The list stays 25 long, so each newly watched title pushes the last one off.

It's rebuilt every 15 minutes instead of hourly, so a title just watched reaches the top promptly. The rolling list is kept for 60 days of nobody opening it.

- Tests: three in `tests/my-lists-addon-charts.test.mjs`, covering yesterday's list surviving midnight, today's watches going on top of the carried-over ones, and a newcomer pushing the 25th title off. All three fail on the previous code.

### 🐛 Dragging to reorder froze the page until it was reloaded

Mouse reordering (Live Preview, its Edit mode, and every other reorderable list) used the browser's native drag-and-drop. That hands the gesture to the operating system's drag loop, while `createSortableList` moves the dragged row around the page underneath it. Moving or re-rendering the source of a native drag is what native drag-and-drop handles worst: the drag can end without `dragend`, or not end at all, and the page ignores clicks until it's reloaded. The earlier fixes reduced the work done on each step of a drag, which never touched this. Automated drags don't exercise the real OS drag loop, which is why none of the tests could reproduce it.

- Every reorder is now driven by pointer events, for mouse, touch and pen alike. That means no native drag, no drag image and no OS drag loop. A drag always ends, on `pointerup`, `pointercancel` or the window losing focus.
- A mouse on a handle starts dragging once it actually moves, so a plain click on a handle isn't a reorder.
- `draggable="true"` was removed from every handle and card. Any native drag that still starts inside a list (an `<img>` is draggable by default) is refused.
- The Edit-mode handle gets `touch-action: none`, like the preview handle, so a touch drag isn't taken over by page scrolling.

Verified in Chromium with real mouse input:
- Live Preview: row 8 dragged to row 19, with the page auto-scrolling about 4,000 px.
- Edit mode: row 8 dragged to row 37.
- A click on a handle leaves the order alone, and the page takes clicks right after a drop.
- Touch drags and a list re-rendered mid-drag still behave.

### 🐛 Wrong posters on list cards, and tiles left blank or "No poster" while btttr.cc was down

**The wrong posters were an ID problem.** On a list card (Discover, My Lists, creator profiles, Curated For You), the poster error handler looked up the list's name instead of the show's. `handlePosterImgError` took the first of `.live-preview-poster-card`, `.list-card` or `[data-title]` above the image. The mini tiles all sit inside a `.list-card`, whose `data-name` is the list's name, so it never reached the tile's own data. A failed poster was then looked up by list name and cached under it:
- "Hulu" matched a show called Paradise, so The Simpsons and American Dad! in the Hulu card both showed Paradise;
- "Prime Video Top 10" matched *Video & Arcade Top 10*, which showed on Lioness;
- "Disney+" and "Trakt Most Played" matched similar near-namesakes.

`posterItemIdentity` now reads the image, then the nearest elements that describe one title, and stops at a list card. It skips anything carrying `data-url`, because the Curated cards' tile wrapper holds the list's title in `data-title`. `resolveMissingPostersInDom` uses it too. For a failed Better Poster, the IMDb id comes from the poster's own URL, which is as certain as it gets.

**The blank and "No poster" tiles were btttr.cc.** On 2026-09-24 its CDN still answered in under a second for anything it had drawn, with copies 3–7 days old. For anything else its origin gave a 504 after 30 s or no answer in 90, and its homepage timed out too. The Worker waited up to 55 s on each such poster, then answered 502, and the page's fallback then looked up the wrong title (above).

- **A tile waits on btttr.cc for 6 s at most.** After that the Worker answers without it, and the fetch carries on in the background (25 s, inside what `waitUntil` allows), so the next visit finds it stored.
  - **The website** gets a 503 and shows the title's own ordinary poster. When the page's `/api/bp/warm` call, which keeps trying for up to 55 s, reports the Better Poster fetched (its response now lists `ready` URLs), the tile switches over. The new image is loaded first, so the swap is one clean change.
  - **Stremio/Nuvio** get the title's ordinary poster from the same URL, marked `no-store`, since an app has no fallback of its own and an error there is a blank tile. It becomes the Better Poster as soon as one exists.
  - Images with no error handler of their own (the builders' picks, the Curated cards) are caught by one capture-phase listener instead of showing a broken-image icon.
- **A failure is remembered for 10 minutes,** in the isolate and the edge cache, so a page of such titles is answered at once instead of each tile waiting on the same dead end.
- **Failures are retried by the cron.** They go on a list (`bp:retry:v1`) that `prewarmBetterPosters` works through first, a random few each tick, until btttr.cc draws them. The list is written at most once a minute per isolate, or once per warm batch, and the cron writes it only when it fetches one.
- **Posters are refreshed daily instead of weekly.** The stored copy is re-fetched once it's a day old, both when it's served and by the cron's pass over the shared charts. The browser and the edge keep it for 6 hours, btttr.cc's own lifetime. Hourly would bring back the same picture almost every time, because btttr.cc's own CDN was serving copies 3–7 days old.

- Tests:
  - `tests/poster-identity.test.mjs` (8, all failing on the previous code) covers the tile's own title being used on Discover, Curated and My Lists cards, no guessing from a list's name, and a stand-in found by the id in a Better Poster's URL and swapped out once warm reports it (only after it has loaded, and back if it then fails).
  - `tests/better-posters-mirror.test.mjs` (7 → 12) adds: the website's 503 after the wait, with the fetch finishing behind it; an app's uncached stand-in; a miss not re-asked; the daily re-fetch; and a failed poster listed, left out of `ready`, and fetched by a later cron tick.

### 🐛 Better Posters loaded slowly or not at all: served from the Worker's own copy now

Tiles sat blank all over the site with Better Posters on, and filled in when it was switched off. btttr.cc serves artwork it has drawn recently from Cloudflare's cache in about 0.2 s, and draws everything else at its origin. That origin was struggling: 40–50 s per poster, or a 504 (its own homepage 504'd after 30 s). Its CDN only keeps a drawing for about a week, so any title nobody had asked for lately came from that origin, and the tile waited with no error to fall back on. Nothing on our side changed; btttr.cc's origin got slow.

- **`/bp/<style>/<imdb id>.jpg`** serves each Better Poster from this Worker's copy (`serveBetterPoster`, in `05_catalog-core.js`). It is fetched from btttr.cc once and then kept:
  - in KV, which is global, so a poster fetched anywhere is instant everywhere;
  - behind the edge cache;
  - refreshed in the background once it is a day old;
  - kept for 60 days, so btttr.cc having a bad day goes unnoticed.

  It accepts only styles and options `buildBetterPosterUrl` can produce (anything else is a 404), so it can't be pointed anywhere else on btttr.cc.
- **The website and the Stremio/Nuvio rows both use it.** The catalog, search and meta routes pass their origin into `betterPostersOptionsFrom`. The badge route reads the copy directly for a `/bp/` URL on its own origin (a Worker fetching its own hostname doesn't reliably reach itself), and another host's `/bp/` still can't get past the poster allowlist.
- **Warming:**
  - **On the website:** every Better Poster that lands on a page, including lazy ones far below the fold, goes to `/api/bp/warm`, so missing posters are fetched while the page is being read. The website sends one batch at a time, the Worker fetches four at a time, and the endpoint is rate-limited per IP.
  - **In the cron:** `prewarmBetterPosters` fetches artwork for every title on the shared charts (the chart pre-warm now remembers their ids, plus the My Lists Addon Charts). It does this for every Better Posters style in use in the last 14 days, recorded as posters are served. Each tick checks 60 title/style pairs and fetches up to 8 missing ones, from the same spare budget as New on Streaming.
- **Every tile shows a Better Poster once btttr.cc has drawn it.** What happens while it hasn't is covered in the entry above.

Measured in Chromium, with a stand-in btttr.cc that takes 8 s to draw a poster: on a second visit, every row's posters appeared within 7–55 ms of scrolling to it. The one wait left is the first time anyone ever looks at a title that isn't on a shared chart.

- Tests: `tests/better-posters-mirror.test.mjs` (7) covers:
  - fetching once, then serving the copy when btttr.cc fails;
  - each style being its own image;
  - nothing outside the real styles and ids being fetched;
  - an uncached answer when btttr.cc can't supply a poster;
  - warming (missing fetched, stored skipped, foreign URLs ignored);
  - the badge route reading the copy, and refusing another host's `/bp/`.

  `tests/better-posters.test.mjs` now expects the `/bp/` URLs. The test harness's KV gained binary values and metadata, as real KV has.

### 🐛 Airing Next and Recommended froze when the website wasn't opened

Both shelves are built by the website and pushed up as snapshots, and nothing on the server rebuilt them. Someone who used only Stremio or Nuvio for ten days saw the same Airing Next the whole time: episodes that had aired still listed as coming, newly announced episodes missing, and shows started since never added. Recommended stayed frozen at whatever the Discover tab last showed.

- **Airing Next drops aired episodes when it's read.** The Stremio/Nuvio row leaves out any episode whose air date is before today, the way the website's own copy already did. Today's episode stays.
- **The cron rebuilds Airing Next.** `refreshAiringNextSweep` (in `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`) applies the website's own rules to the account's tracking record:
  - The same shows qualify: every show with a watched episode plus fully watched ones, up to 60.
  - The same "removed from Airing Next" rule applies.
  - Entries are built field for field like the website's, with the same de-duplication and soonest-first order.
  - Each show is looked up through the same cached details lookup the website's `/api/details/batch` uses.

  Each account is rebuilt at most every 6 hours, which is the website's own refresh interval. The sweep does 3 accounts per tick at the 6-minute cron, so it covers about 180 accounts at that interval before stretching. It is paid from the episode sweep's unused reserve, like New on Streaming.

  A rebuild writes only the Airing Next field of the tracking record, against a fresh read, so nothing a browser or playback saved meanwhile is lost. It does not touch `clientVersion`, so the next website save doesn't conflict. In D1 it writes only the `airing_next` rows (`saveAiringNextD1`), and only when D1 was already current.
- **Recommended builds its own list once the Discover snapshot is 3 days old.** It uses the same algorithm the website calls. `/api/recommendations` and the catalog row now share `buildTmdbRecommendations`. The row is seeded from the account's Continue Watching, Watch History and Watchlist, up to 12 per side, so recent viewing shapes it. The old snapshot is kept as a fallback only if nothing can be built.
- **The website re-stamps an unchanged snapshot every 12 hours.** It used to skip saving when its recommendations hadn't changed. A daily Discover user who got the same list would then have looked abandoned and been switched to the server's list. The stamp now records when Discover was last shown, and it is part of the tracking push signature, so the re-stamp is actually sent.

- Tests: `tests/airing-and-recs-live.test.mjs` (11). They cover aired episodes leaving the row, the cron rebuilding from Watch History (including a show watched since the last snapshot, served through D1), removals honoured, a TMDB outage keeping entries instead of emptying the shelf, the rest of the record and `clientVersion` left alone, Recommended serving a fresh snapshot, building its own for a stale one, falling back to the stale one, the route and row sharing one builder, and the website's 12-hour re-stamp. The six behavior tests fail on the previous code.

### 🐛 Personal lists in Stremio and Nuvio stopped updating

- **Playing anything in Stremio, Nuvio or Plex emptied the Watchlist row.** The Watchlist is stored in three places, and the Stremio/Nuvio row read the one inside the account's tracking record. Both playback scrobbles read that record from D1, which has no Watchlist column, and then wrote it back, so every play left it with an empty Watchlist or none. The row showed nothing, or only what the website had pushed since the last play. New additions never seemed to arrive. The row, and the Watchlist the website loads, now use whichever copy is newest. The list record is never rebuilt by anything else, so accounts already hit by this recover without doing anything. The scrobbles now put the Watchlist back before they write.
- **Continue Watching, Watch History and Airing Next could serve D1 rows that a failed save had left behind.** A save writes its "up to date" stamp and then one D1 statement per item, in chunks. The stamp went first, so a save that died partway (a later chunk, or the per-request operation cap on a long Watch History) still made D1 look current. Removals, being the last statements of all, were the first to be lost. The stamp is now written last. A failed D1 write also leaves a small marker, and while that marker is set the Stremio/Nuvio rows read the newer KV copy instead of D1.
- **Recommended Movies/Shows, and the Trakt and MDBList progress shelves, were sent with a 24-hour public cache.** Only the add-on's own tracked shelves were marked uncacheable, so these per-account rows could sit a day stale in the apps. So could a merged row that contained a personal shelf on any line but the first. All of them are now `no-store` (`STREMIO_LIVE_ROW_SOURCES`).

- Tests: `tests/tracked-shelves-stay-live.test.mjs` (7). They cover a play not emptying the Watchlist row and dropping only the played title, an already-emptied account recovering in the row, on the website and on the next play, the row serving KV while D1 is behind (and D1's stamp not advancing on a half-write), and the no-store headers. All 7 fail on the previous code.

### 🐛 Dragging in Live Preview and its Edit mode bogged the page down

Every step of a drag did the whole page's layout work again. The work was proportional to the number of posters on the page and was repeated several times a second. On a phone it added up to a page that stopped responding.

- The dragged row was re-inserted on every `dragover` and every auto-scroll frame, even when it hadn't moved. Each re-insert discarded the page's layout, so the next position check re-laid-out everything. It also handed the row to the page-wide poster-badge observer, which re-badged every poster in it. The row now only moves when its place changes.
- The rows it is placed among were found with a query over every descendant, walking every poster of every shelf. It now checks sibling rows only.
- The scrolling container was looked up with `getComputedStyle` on every ancestor, every frame. It is now looked up once per drag. Scroll anchoring is also switched off for the drag, so the browser's own scroll correction doesn't fight a tall row being carried past the fold.
- A drag that ended without telling the list is now ended by a watchdog. This happens when the list is re-rendered under it (a background sync applying your config) or a native drag goes silent. The old code kept its auto-scroll loop running indefinitely and re-attached a ghost copy of the dragged row to the list.

Measured in Chromium on a 40-shelf Live Preview with CPU slowed 6× (a phone): during a 4-second drag held at the bottom edge, 240 frames rendered instead of 169, and the page scrolled 3,516 px instead of 2,478. Not covered by the node test suite, which has no real layout.

### 🐛 Story Lock: the next day jumped to a different season instead of continuing the story

Story Lock walks a locked show's run in broadcast order, 3 a night on a rotating channel: S1E1-3, then S1E4-6, then S1E7-9. That only held within one day. The next day's block could land in a completely different season (S1E1-3 tonight, S3E1-3 tomorrow). Four things broke the walk:

- **The show could sit out a night.** Each day's shows were a seeded draw (24 out of whatever the pool holds), but the walk moved forward on calendar days, so a night off *skipped a block*. A show that missed one night came back three episodes further on, and with short seasons that jump landed in another season. A story-locked show is now on **every** night. It counts against the shows-per-day dial, and only the slots left over go to the draw.
- **The walk counted days since 1970.** A block was `day % blocks`, with `day` in the tens of thousands. Any change to the length of the run (a new episode from "Automatically add new episodes", a Live Cloud Sync rebuild, an edit in the builder) changed `blocks` and threw the show to an unrelated block, often in another season. The walk now counts nights **from the day the show was locked** (`storyLockedSince`, stamped by the builder when the box is ticked). A newly locked show starts at its first episode that day. On the first pass through the run, new episodes just extend the walk and nothing moves.
- **"Hide watched" re-cut the run underneath the walk.** Watching along dutifully made it *worse*: one night rewound to S1E4-6 and the next jumped to S2E4-6. With Hide watched on and a watch history to follow, a locked show now just follows the viewer and airs the first unwatched episodes in order. Watch S1E1-3 and S1E4-6 is next. Miss a night and S1E1-3 waits for you. Binge to E9 and E10 is next. With no history at all (an account with no tracking), it walks the calendar, so it is never stuck on S1E1-3.
- **The last block of the run replayed the episode before it** whenever the run wasn't a multiple of the block size. A run of eight aired E6 twice every cycle. The cycle now ends on a short block (E7-8) and wraps to E1.

Locks saved before this change have no start date. They count from 24 September 2026 and keep walking in order. Unticking and ticking a show again starts it over from episode 1.

What this still does not survive: once a show has looped through its whole run, a change in the run's length moves the walk by about one block per loop so far. It stays in order within the night, but a stretch replays (the run grew) or is skipped (it shrank). Changing the episodes-a-night dial re-cuts the blocks the same way. Avoiding both would need a stored cursor, and lineups are resolved statelessly from the payload and the clock. With Hide watched on and a watch history to follow, the history is the cursor, so neither applies.

- Tests: tests/worker.test.mjs covers a new lock starting at episode 1, a growing run that keeps its place, Hide watched following the viewer through a missed night and a binge, an empty history falling back to the calendar, a full cycle in broadcast order across seasons, no night off with a full dial, a short final block, and share links carrying the lock dates. tests/client.test.mjs covers the builder stamping a lock and keeping the stamp through saves.

### 🐛 My Lists Addon Charts: "null iv", shorter names, 25 titles each

- **"null iv" at the top of Most Watched (and in the admin Trending table) was not a title.** Some watches reached `/api/track-event` with an id that had already been through `String(null)`, so they arrived as the text `"null"`. All of them counted as one title with the id "null". The chart then asked TMDB to name that id, which returned an unrelated movie called "null iv". Fixed in three places:
  - `isJunkTrackedId` (03_admin.js) rejects `null` / `undefined` / `NaN` / `true` / `false` ids in `/api/track-event`, `recordTrackedEvent` (which also covers the scrobbler) and the website's beacon.
  - `computeLeaderboard` skips such ids, so the counts already recorded under "null" disappear from the admin table and the charts without touching stored data.
  - Most Watched only charts real title ids (`tt…` or `tmdb:…`). A bare number is ambiguous: the Trakt importer falls back to an episode's TMDB id when a show has no IMDb id. The snapshot key moved to `v2`, so live charts rebuild on their next request.
- **Renamed:** "Most Watched Today", "Most Watched 7 Days" and "Most Watched 30 Days". Links using the old `/lists/My-Lists-Addon-Most-Watched-…` slugs still resolve (`LEGACY_CHART_SLUGS`).
- **The three Most Watched charts are capped at 25 titles** (`MOST_WATCHED_MAX_ITEMS`). New on Streaming is not capped: it pages through the whole 30-day window.

### 🐛 New on Streaming: "No poster" and "Not found or TMDB error" on some shows

JustWatch's IMDb id is sometimes wrong. *Mysteries at the Museum* came through as tt8113838 and *The Kitchen* as tt3547488, and Cinemeta has nothing for either. *WWE Raw* came through as tt2932286, an IMDb duplicate record that Cinemeta lists as `#DUPE#`; the real one is tt0185103. With a wrong id, TMDB has no match, so the website shows "No poster" and clicking the title says "Not found or TMDB error". Stremio can't find streams for it either. JustWatch's TMDB id is right (4656 for WWE Raw, which Cinemeta also maps to tt0185103).

- **The sweep now takes the IMDb id from TMDB** (`resolveJustWatchIds`): `/{movie|tv}/{tmdbId}?append_to_response=external_ids`. The same request also gives a poster when JustWatch has none. A title TMDB knows with no IMDb id is stored as `tmdb:<id>`, which the website opens fine.
- **Each title is checked once.** Rows written from TMDB's answer are stamped `last_seen_walk = 2` (`NOS_ID_CHECKED`). That column is left over from the old TMDB-walk engine, so no migration is needed. Later sweeps reuse a checked row's id without asking TMDB again.
- **Old rows under a wrong id are deleted** once the right one is written.
- **Lookup budget:** up to 300 lookups per sweep (`NEW_ON_STREAMING_JW_MAX_ID_LOOKUPS`), taken from the cron's outbound-fetch share. A day that needs more stops at that page and finishes on the next sweep. If `TMDB_API_KEY` is not set, JustWatch's ids are used as before.

### ⭐ My Lists Addon Charts: New on Streaming and Most Watched, on the website

- **New Quick Add section, "My Lists Addon Charts"** (Catalogs → Quick Add, first card), with "+ Movies" / "+ Shows" on each chart and "+ Add all":
  - **New on Streaming**: what just arrived on Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Apple TV+, Paramount+ and Peacock, newest first. A show moves back to the top when new episodes land. It was already a working catalog; it just had no public entry until now. The separate "ships dark" card and its per-service rows are gone, along with `NEW_ON_STREAMING_IN_QUICK_ADD`.
  - **My Lists Addon Most Watched Today / (7 Days) / (30 Days)**: what people using the add-on watched, ranked by the same "watched" counts as the admin Trending Data tab (`computeLeaderboard`). New source `mylists:most-watched:today|7|30` (`fetchMostWatchedCatalog`), split into movies and shows. Windows are Eastern calendar days, like that tab.
- **Discover All / Movies / Shows** lead with the same four charts, credited "by My Lists Addon". Each chart also gets a shareable `/lists/<slug>` page, e.g. `/lists/My-Lists-Addon-Most-Watched-7-Days`. Everything is driven by one table, `MY_LISTS_ADDON_CHARTS` (08_quickadd-chart-data.js).
- **How Most Watched stays current:** each window/type is a KV snapshot (`mylists:mostwatched:v1:<window>:<type>`). The 7- and 30-day charts rebuild on the first request of each Eastern day. "Today" rebuilds hourly, because a once-a-day "today" would sit empty all morning.
- **Cost of a rebuild:** one D1 query plus the stored titles. Posters for IMDb ids are Metahub URLs, so they need no API call. At most 20 TMDB lookups per build (`MOST_WATCHED_MAX_LOOKUPS`), for ids with no IMDb poster, which keeps a build within a free-plan request's 50-fetch allowance. Stray episode ids are folded into their show. A failed rebuild serves the previous snapshot.
- `mylists:most-watched:` is allowed by the preview endpoint's source allowlist (`isAllowedCatalogSourceUrl`). The list page's "Add" button files these rows under "My Lists Addon Charts".
- Tests: tests/my-lists-addon-charts.test.mjs covers ranking, the movie/show split, episode folding, snapshot refresh (daily and hourly), KV-only deployments, the empty state, the Quick Add card, the Discover feed and the `/lists/<slug>` pages.

### 🐛 New on Streaming: days over JustWatch's 600-entry cap were cut short

Compared the whole Sep 5–21 range against a saved copy of mdblist.com/new-on-streaming. The biggest gap was **Sep 12**: mdblist had 864 titles, and we had 600 entries. JustWatch's `newTitles` stops every query at 600 (`JUSTWATCH_NEW_TITLES_CAP`), and that day Prime Video alone added more than 600 movies. Now a query that reports a capped `totalCount` is split into narrower queries that together cover the same results: by service, then movies vs. seasons, then by halving the release-year range (`splitJustWatchSlice`). The split pieces are saved with each day's progress, so a big day can finish over several sweeps. Up to 30 pages per sweep.

Result of the comparison: of 2,189 mdblist titles, 1,934 match ours on the same day. About 160 more are probably the same title named differently (JustWatch sometimes gives the original-language title, e.g. *W jak morderstwo* for *In for a Murder*). 30 are titles we already moved to Sep 22, a day mdblist had not finished loading. That leaves about 55 unexplained titles on each side.

### 🔁 New on Streaming now reads JustWatch, the same feed mdblist uses

The fixes below made RapidAPI collect its data properly, but the list still didn't match mdblist. The rest of the gap was the **data itself**. RapidAPI's crawler lists titles mdblist never has, like the 2024 *Road House* "on Hulu", Peacock's *Velvet* and *seaQuest DSV*, or *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* dated four days after its last episode. The sweep now reads **JustWatch's `newTitles` GraphQL feed**, which is what mdblist's New on Streaming is built on:

- **Same services as mdblist's picker.** It asks for the same eight JustWatch packages mdblist ticks by default: `nfx`, `amp`, `dnp`, `atp`, `hlu`, `mxx`, `pct` (Peacock Premium), `ppp` (Paramount Plus Premium). Subscription only (`FLATRATE`). They're stored as `jwPackage` on `NEW_ON_STREAMING_PROVIDERS`.
- **Same dates, same episode rule.** Each Movie or Season edge is filed under the day JustWatch dates it. When a season gains episodes, JustWatch lists it again on that day, and that is what moves a show back to the top. Within a day, titles keep JustWatch's order.
- **How the sweep reads the feed** (`sweepJustWatchNewOnStreaming`): the last 3 days are re-read every 2 hours, because a JustWatch day keeps filling up. Older days in the 30-day window are read once, newest first, and resume from a saved cursor if a sweep runs out of pages. Progress is saved in KV (`cron:newonstreaming:jwdays:US`). Up to 20 pages of 100 per sweep. No API key and no quota.
- Posters come from `images.justwatch.com`. The TMDB episode bump is skipped, since the feed already has the episodes.
- **Checked live against the real API:** Sep 22 includes every title in mdblist's Sep 22 row (All Saints, Call Me Fitz, Transformers: Rescue Bots, Haven, Yukon Gold, The Willies, Miss Dial, Stan Helsing), and *Tuner*, *Best Medicine* and *GTO* land on Sep 21 as they do on mdblist.
- **RapidAPI is still there.** Set the Worker var `NEW_ON_STREAMING_ENGINE = "rapidapi"` to switch back.
- **Terms of use:** JustWatch's GraphQL API is the one its own website calls. It has no key and no published terms for third-party use. Using it is the operator's decision.

### 🐛 New on Streaming: why it did not match mdblist, and the fixes

What [mdblist.com/new-on-streaming](https://mdblist.com/new-on-streaming/) actually is (its own changelog, Aug 20 2026): JustWatch's "new" feed, grouped by day, sorted by the date a title became available on a service. JustWatch's feed has two kinds of entry: a **movie** getting an offer on a service, and a **season** getting one. That includes an existing season whose offer gains episodes, and it also includes daily shows (*The Daily Show, season 31, 1 new episode* dated Sep 22). So a show does jump back to the top when a new episode lands on the service. Our design was right about that. The data collection was what was broken:

- **Most changes were never read.** A regular sweep read each change type **newest-first** with a fixed page count (1 page of new titles, 2 of episodes, 1 of seasons: 25 changes a page), then moved its window forward to the next sweep. Anything past those pages was gone for good: the 1st-of-the-month catalogue dumps, a 20-episode season drop, a busy evening of next-day episodes. The `/changes` feed is now four resumable streams (`NEW_ON_STREAMING_STREAMS`: new titles, new seasons, new episodes, removals), each read **oldest-first** from where it last stopped, and each follows RapidAPI's cursor across sweeps. A tick polls every stream once, then spends what is left on new titles first, then seasons, then episodes. Resume state is in KV (`cron:newonstreaming:streams:US`), and the admin tab shows how far each stream has read.
- **Page slots were spent on the wrong catalogues.** The sweep asked for bare `prime` and `apple`, which is every Prime Video Channels title, every Amazon rental and essentially the whole iTunes Store. Each of those changes used a slot on the page before being thrown away. It now asks for `<service>.subscription` (plus `peacock.free`) only. Add-on channels (Starz via Prime, Max via Hulu) are also filtered out, because JustWatch lists them as providers of their own. Before, they were labelled with the service they were sold through.
- **Daily shows were filtered out.** The old comment said this matched MDBList, but it does not: mdblist's Sep 21 row has *Good Morning America* in it. Talk, news and game shows are kept now.
- **The TMDB fallback bumped the wrong rows.** `bumpNewOnStreamingEpisodes` moved **every** service row of a show to the day an episode aired on its broadcast network. So *Live PD* airing on A&E put Netflix's library copy at the top as "new on Netflix". Now it only moves a service's own row, and only when the show is that service's original (`NEW_ON_STREAMING_ORIGINAL_NETWORKS`, TMDB network ids). RapidAPI's episode stream handles everything else, because it sees the episode land on the service itself.
- **A removed title could come back.** Replaying an arrival older than a recorded removal cleared `removed_at`. The upsert now only clears it for a change newer than the removal.
- **Budget:** sweeps run every 6 hours. Each one spends the month's remaining quota spread over the runs left (`newOnStreamingTickBudget`, 4–16 pages), still under the 950 safety cap. "Clear & pull fresh data" still backfills newest-first and then hands over to the streams.
- The admin preview is grouped by day, like mdblist, so the two can be compared side by side.
- Tests: resuming across sweeps from the cursor, poll-then-priority page allocation, subscription-only catalogues, add-on filtering, the daily removals throttle, daily shows kept, removals not undone by a replay, originals-only TMDB bumps, and the tick budget. The TMDB bump tests no longer send real requests to RapidAPI.

### ⭐ Better Posters (btttr.cc)

- **Settings -> Account & Sync -> Better Posters** swaps plain poster artwork for [BetterPosters](https://btttr.cc/) -- posters with the genre, rating and tags drawn into the image itself rather than laid over it. **Off by default**, and needs no API key or account: BetterPosters keys off the IMDb id alone.
- **Applies across the whole product.** On the website: Live Preview, Search, Discover, My Lists, creator profiles, the Custom List and Channel builders, list "See All" pages and the title details modal. In your apps: catalog rows, the search catalog and the title pages Stremio/Nuvio request (`/meta/`). The website re-renders the moment you tick the box; an existing install link needs a Save/Update for the app side.
- Only movies and shows with an IMDb id are touched. A TMDB-only item, a TV Channel's generated artwork, an episode still and any landscape tile keep the poster they already had (BetterPosters only renders 2:3 artwork).
- Style controls mirror btttr.cc's own configurator: **Genre**, **Rating** (with a source picker -- IMDb, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, Trakt, Letterboxd, Roger Ebert), **Trend tags**, **Quality tags** (4K/DV/Atmos), **Age rating**, and a **poster language**. Each defaults to btttr.cc's own default, so leaving them alone produces exactly the URL its configurator hands out.
- **Poster badges still work on top of it.** The BetterPosters swap runs *before* the badge pass, so a premiere/finale/air-date chip is drawn over the BetterPosters artwork instead of replacing it. The Adult Content Filter still overrides both.
- The settings ride the same Creator Profile sync as the badge settings, so enabling it in one browser enables it in the next.
- Every poster on the website resolves through one funnel (`resolveClientPoster`, `19_client-search-and-likes.js`), which the surfaces above already reached via `resolveListCardItemPoster` (17), `resolveItemPoster` (22), `livePreviewPosterHtml` (23), `renderMediaCard` (16) and `loadPosterSlot` (19). The client mirror of the Worker's URL builder lives next to it, and the two are pinned to the same expected URLs by the same test file.

### 🐛 Drag-to-reorder stopped dead at the bottom of the screen

- Nothing scrolled the page while a drag was in progress. `moveItem` places the dragged row among the rows **currently on screen**, so on any list taller than the window -- which is most of them once Live Preview shelves carry posters and each row is ~200px -- dragging past the last visible row did nothing: the row stopped at the edge and sat there. That is what "the drag freezes and won't move the list" was, and it applied to every list `createSortableList` drives (Catalogs, Live Preview, Your Custom Lists, the builders) on desktop and touch alike.
- `createSortableList` now auto-scrolls when the pointer comes within 90px of an edge, ramping to 20px per frame at the very edge, and re-places the row against the rows that scroll into view. It drives this from its own animation-frame loop rather than from `dragover`/`pointermove`, because those stop firing the moment the pointer is held still at the edge -- which is exactly when scrolling needs to continue. It scrolls the nearest scrollable ancestor when there is one (lists inside panels) and the window otherwise.
- Verified against the failing case in a real browser: a 12-row list at 2584px in a 900px window. Before, dragging row 1 to the bottom edge and holding it there moved it three places and left `window.scrollY` at 0. After, the same drag carries it to seventh with the page scrolled 1008px. **Not covered by the test suite** -- it needs real layout and a real pointer, and CI runs on bare node + python with no browser.

### ⭐ Watchlist posters now carry the same badges as Continue Watching and Airing Next

- A show on your Watchlist with an episode coming got no premiere chip and no date chip. Three separate gates kept it out, all of them testing for `continue-watching`: the Airing Next data was only loaded for that slug, the lookup maps were only built for it, and the enrichment only ran for it. All three now include `watchlist`, so a watchlist entry is matched against the same Airing Next record and carries the same `airDate` / `isSeasonPremiere` / finale fields.
- The fully-watched filtering stays Continue Watching only, deliberately: a watchlist is what you **mean** to watch, not a progress shelf, so dropping finished shows out of it would be wrong.
- New **Watchlist Catalogs in Stremio** toggle under **Poster Badges & Labels → Stremio & Nuvio (Artwork Overlays)**, alongside the Airing Next and Continue Watching ones. It is independent of the catalogs toggle, and the master Stremio switch still overrides it.
- Live Preview shows the same chips. On the website a Watchlist shelf is a catalog row, so it follows the existing **Catalogs & Live Preview** toggle there, while Stremio/Nuvio follow the new one.

### 🐛 The Stremio badge toggles never reached your install link

- `showBadgesStremio*` were missing from `/api/save`'s allowlist on **both** sides -- the builder page never sent them and the endpoint would have dropped them anyway -- so switching any of them off never left the browser. The setting looked saved and the badges kept appearing in Stremio/Nuvio. It read as harmless only because these default to ON; the identical gap left Better Posters, which defaults off, looking completely dead.
- All five now travel, named once in `STREMIO_BADGE_KEYS` (`00_constants.js`) so the four places that must agree -- the save request, the stored payload, `resolveConfig`, and the badge gate in `fetchCatalog` -- cannot drift apart. Only a switched-off toggle is written, so an all-on config does not grow by a single key.
- This was flagged earlier as a known gap and deliberately left alone. It stopped being optional the moment the new Watchlist toggle needed the same path to work at all.

### ⭐ Better Posters on the Curated For You / Recommended cards

- BetterPosters is keyed by **IMDB id and nothing else** -- there is no `/poster/tmdb/...` route, it 404s. `/api/recommendations` answers with `tmdb:<n>` ids, because TMDB's recommendation endpoints return TMDB ids and nothing else, so those two cards had nothing for a BetterPosters URL to be built from. The identical rows in Live Preview and in Stremio/Nuvio *did* get the artwork, because `fetchCuratedCatalog` translates the ids on the way through and the dashboard card never did.
- New `/api/imdb-ids` translates a small batch of TMDB ids to IMDB ids, each edge-cached for a day, and the cards patch their tiles once it answers.
- **Bounded on purpose.** `/api/recommendations` returns up to 40 movies *and* 40 shows; resolving all 80 up front would need 80 outbound requests on a dashboard load and blow the 50-subrequest ceiling a free Workers plan gets. The client asks only for the tiles it is about to draw -- roughly 9 for a card, more as a See All page is scrolled -- and the endpoint refuses more than `IMDB_ID_LOOKUP_MAX` (24) per call. A resolved id is cached in the page, and a miss is cached too, so a title TMDB has no IMDB id for is not asked about again.
- 11 tests in `tests/imdb-ids.test.mjs` covering both halves: the endpoint's translation, its movie-vs-tv routing, an episode id resolving to its show, non-TMDB input making no outbound call at all, and the per-request cap; plus the client pass staying silent while the setting is off, patching both the tile and the `data-poster` the modal reads back, and never asking about an id twice. Both halves mutation-tested.

### 🐛 Reset Account Data left created channels behind

- Channels keep the same kind of in-memory copy custom lists do, and `loadLocalChannels` returns it **before** consulting storage. `clearLocalAccountData` cleared only the custom-list pair, so a reset wiped the stored channels and the very next read handed them straight back from memory -- and the next save wrote them out again and synced them up to the account that had just been emptied.
- `_memoryChannelsMap` / `_memoryChannelsString` are now cleared alongside their custom-list equivalents. This is the same bug, one cache over, that the sessionStorage sweep beside it was added to fix for lists.
- The server side was already correct: `purgeCreatorData` deletes `creatorchannels:` and `creatorsyncchannels:` along with everything else.
- Three tests in `tests/account-reset.test.mjs`, including one pinning that a save *after* a reset cannot write the old channels back. Mutation-tested.

### 🐛 Airing Next tiles showed "No poster" in Live Preview

- `_liveFallbackMeta` read `it.poster` and nothing else. Airing Next items carry no poster of their own, and My Lists only ever showed one because `resolveListCardItemPoster` falls back to `showPoster` and then to a metahub poster built from the show's IMDb id. Live Preview had no such fallback, so the same items rendered as empty tiles there -- and turning Better Posters on masked it, since that builds a URL from the id and never needs a poster field at all.
- Live Preview now resolves the poster through the same helper the Lists tab uses, so the two surfaces agree. Verified in a real browser with poster-less Airing Next items: the tiles render, against the same metahub URLs My Lists uses.

### 🐛 Live Preview showed a different Continue Watching than the Lists tab

- Live Preview substitutes a locally-known sample for what `/api/preview` returns on Continue Watching and Airing Next. `getFallbackShelfSample` tried a connected **Trakt** account **first, for any such row whatever its URL** -- so a row tracked by this add-on (`autotrack:continue-watching:...`) was shown the Trakt account's shelf instead of its own. Two different accounts, two different sets of shows: that is why the Lists tab and Live Preview disagreed about the same row, and why syncing the add-on's own shelf to the account changed nothing, since this path never read it.
- The fallback now comes from the account that actually backs the row: an `autotrack:` row uses this add-on's own list -- the exact list the Lists tab renders -- and everything else keeps the behaviour it had, Trakt's copy first with the add-on's list only as a last resort.
- Verified in a real browser with all three sources present at once and deliberately different: an `autotrack:` row renders the add-on's items, and a `trakt:` row still renders Trakt's. **Not covered by the test suite** -- it needs `renderLivePreview` against real DOM, and CI has no browser.

### 🐛 Loading a preset put old Continue Watching / Airing Next items back, permanently

- A preset records **which** shelves you had, not what was on them -- but for a personal auto-tracked shelf those are not the same thing. `rebuildCustomListsFromPreset` merged a preset's saved copy of `continue-watching`, `airing-next`, `watch-history` and `watchlist` **into your live shelf**: additive, with nothing marking which items came from the preset, so a preset built months ago silently put months-old shows back into Continue Watching with no way to tell them apart or take them out again.
- Worse, that merge set `hasTrackingChanges`, which pushed the mixture up to your account via `pushTrackingSync`. The account's copy is what the add-on serves to Stremio/Nuvio and what Live Preview falls back to when My Lists has not loaded yet this session -- which is why the same shelf could show one thing on the Lists tab and something older in Live Preview and in your apps.
- Loading a preset now leaves all four alone entirely: they always follow your account. The load toast says so, so "nothing happened" does not read as a bug.
- **Backup/Restore is deliberately unchanged** -- restoring your watch history is the whole point of a backup. It is only a *preset*, which is a set of shelves, that has no business carrying their contents.

### ⭐ "Remove duplicate items across lists" now skips your personal shelves

- Continue Watching, Airing Next, Watch History and Watchlist are excluded from the feature **in both directions**: never stripped, and never a source of strips. Continue Watching exists to show what you are part-way through -- losing a show from it because Trending listed the same title higher up is not de-duplication, it is the shelf failing at its one job. The reverse would be just as surprising: a title vanishing from Trending because it is in your Watchlist.
- Applies to every provider's version of these shelves (`autotrack:`, Trakt, MDBList, Simkl), and to a merged row that carries one among its sources. Live Preview applies the identical rule, so the editor shows what the install actually serves.
- Deduplication between two ordinary lists is unchanged, and a test pins that.

### ⭐ A Like button on a channel's "See All", the same as a list's

- A list's **See All** page has always had a heart beside **+ Add**; a channel opened from **Explore Channels** did not -- even though the directory's own cards show a heart and `/api/channel/like` has been behind them all along. Both pages are the same page (`openChannelDetailsPage` delegates to `openListDetailsPage`), and its Like branch keyed entirely off a *list URL*, so a `channel:` URL fell through the exclusion list and the button was simply hidden.
- A channel is liked by its **published code** against `/api/channel/like`, not by a URL against the list ledger, so the details page now has a channel-flavoured branch: `previewDirectoryChannel` hands its code to `openChannelDetailsPage`, which passes it on as `opts.channelLikeCode`. The button clears `dataset.url` in that mode, which is what makes the delegated `.searchLikeExternalBtn` handler stand aside -- exactly the arrangement the directory's own hearts already use.
- The heart is shown only for a channel opened **from the directory**. One of your own saved channels has nothing published to like, so it stays hidden there, as before.
- `syncChannelLikeButton` keeps the details-page heart in step: `renderChannelDirectory()` repaints the feed's own hearts, but that feed is not on screen while the details page is.

### 🐛 Better Posters broke Airing Next and Continue Watching posters in Stremio/Nuvio

- `/api/poster-badge` validates its `poster` parameter against `POSTER_IMAGE_HOSTS` -- an SSRF / open-image-proxy guard, and a set defined as "hosts this add-on itself puts in a poster field". Better Posters made btttr.cc one of those hosts without adding it, so the endpoint **404'd every badged BetterPosters poster**. That is precisely the Airing Next and Continue Watching rows, the two that always carry a badge, which is why they showed broken tiles while unbadged rows (Watchlist, provider lists) rendered fine.
- `btttr.cc` added to the set. The guard itself is unchanged and still rejects everything else: new tests cover a look-alike host (`btttr.cc.evil.example.com`), a suffix match (`notbtttr.cc`), plain `http://`, and an unrelated origin, alongside the hosts that were already allowed.
- The earlier ordering test asserted the badge URL *contained* the btttr.cc URL, and that stayed true the whole time -- it never asked whether the endpoint would then serve it. That is the gap these tests close.

### 🐛 Better Posters never reached Stremio or Nuvio

- **The setting was dropped on the way into the install link.** `/api/save` -- the KV-backed short link that Stremio and Nuvio actually install whenever a `CONFIGS` namespace is bound, i.e. the normal deployment -- rebuilds its stored payload from an **allowlist** of body fields, and so does the POST body the builder page sends it. `betterPosters` was named in neither, so it never left the browser and was never stored. `resolveConfig` then read it back as `false`, and the apps got the plain artwork while the website showed the feature working. Only the base64 fallback link (used when no KV is bound, or when the save fails) ever carried it.
- Both halves now carry `betterPosters` and its style keys. The language and rating source are validated against btttr.cc's accepted values at the save endpoint too -- it is unauthenticated, and the value is interpolated into a URL, so there is no reason to persist one the service would reject.
- Six new tests go through `/api/save` end to end rather than seeding KV directly, which is precisely how this slipped past the first round: every earlier test wrote the config straight into KV and so never exercised the allowlist on either side. Each half is mutation-tested -- reverting the server fix fails three, reverting the client fix fails two.

### 🐛 Two poster bugs found while wiring Better Posters into the website

- **`renderMediaCard` skipped the poster funnel whenever a card already had a poster.** It read `item.poster || resolveClientPoster(...)`, so the fallback only ran when there was nothing to fall back to -- meaning the **Adult Content Filter never applied to any card rendered through it** (search result cards, Custom List picks, Channel Builder picks). Now always resolved through the funnel. Covered by a test that fails against the old expression.
- **A filtered adult poster leaked through `data-poster` in the Live Preview.** `livePreviewPosterHtml` assigned its resolved poster back onto the item (`m.poster = ...`) and the card's `data-poster` attribute -- what the poster modal reads back -- then happened to pick up the safe URL from that mutation. Resolving into a local (needed so a Better Posters URL cannot stick after the setting is switched off, with no original left to restore) exposed that the attribute had been relying on the side effect; it now uses the resolved value explicitly.

**A note on the reference project.** [`StrayBer/nuvio-better-posters-addon`](https://github.com/StrayBer/nuvio-better-posters-addon) solves a different problem: it is a *wrapper* add-on that proxies somebody else's manifest and rewrites the posters in the responses flowing through it. This add-on builds its own catalogs, so none of that proxy machinery (upstream fetching, manifest merging, config tokens for wrapped URLs) is needed here -- the useful part was the poster-URL contract, about forty lines. Two things were corrected in the process: that project pins the single path `/poster/imdb/poster-default/{id}.jpg`, which is the **default style only** -- the style actually lives in the *first* path segment, and the `poster-default` segment it varies is ignored by the service (every value returns byte-identical artwork). It also scrapes `meta.poster` for an IMDb id, which here would match this add-on's own badge URLs (`/api/poster-badge?...&id=tt...`) and round-trip an already-badged poster back through BetterPosters; only the id fields are read.


### ⭐ Customize button on Discover and Search lists

- Every list card on Discover (all sub-tabs -- All, Movies, Shows, Popular Lists, Curated, Hidden Gems, Kids, Holidays, Genres) and in the Search tab's list search now has a **Customize** button alongside its **+ Add**, the same idea as the Storylines & Universes grid's own Customize button. Since these lists are plain movie/show catalogs rather than a saga's episode-level programming, it loads the list's items into the **Custom List Builder**'s editable draft instead of the Channel Builder -- add, remove, or reorder titles, then Save -- rather than immediately copying the list as-is the way **+ Add** or the existing "Copy to Custom List" buttons do (`loadListToCustomListDraft`, `21_client-custom-list-builder.js`).
- Uses the same bounded preview fetch already filling each card's own poster strip (up to ~100 items per type), not an exhaustive full-list fetch -- a hand-edited draft is for curating a short list, and a shelf like TMDB Trending can run into the thousands.

### 🐛 A saga's "See All" page showed no ratings past its first 9 posters

- The Storylines & Universes grid's own card only ever resolves ratings for the first 9 posters it actually shows (`previewPosters = event.episodes.slice(0, 9)`); a longer saga's remaining items (Marvel's 12-movie Infinity Saga, past part 9) were never asked about at all. That was invisible on the grid itself, but the saga's "See All" page (`openStorylineDetails` -> `openListDetailsPage`) has no slot-patching of its own -- it only ever renders whatever rating an item already carries -- so every poster past the ninth showed no rating there either.
- `openStorylineDetails` (`20_client-channel-builder.js`) now awaits every item's rating (reusing the grid's own cache, and resolving whatever isn't cached yet) before opening the "See All" page, so every poster carries its rating up front. `resolveStorylineRatings` now returns a Promise a caller can await, and tracks in-flight ids by their actual fetch Promise (not just a Set) so a caller needing every id waits on one someone else already started fetching instead of skipping it.
- New test covers a 12-item saga specifically: the grid resolves parts 1-9, and opening its "See All" page resolves parts 10-12 fresh before the page opens.

### 🐛 Storylines & Universes rating badges were in the wrong place

- **After the fix below made the badges visible, they showed up as a colored top-left overlay on the poster** -- inconsistent with every other poster tile in the app, which shows its rating as a plain inline star+number beside the year instead (Discover's own `loadPosterSlot`, `19_client-search-and-likes.js`, sharing the identical `list-card-mini-poster-tile` markup). The Channel Builder grid's rating slot (`renderStorylinesUniverseList`, `20_client-channel-builder.js`) moved out of the poster image wrapper and into the year line, and `applyStorylineRatingBadges` was simplified to always use `formatRatingSpanHtml` -- the same formatter, same placement, both Storylines surfaces and Discover now share.
- New test confirms the rating slot renders inside the year line rather than the poster image wrapper.

### 🐛 Storylines & Universes rating badges were invisible

- **The rating badges shipped on the Storylines, Sagas & Universes grid were in the DOM but never visible**: `applyStorylineRatingBadges` (`20_client-channel-builder.js`) handed the resolved number to `formatRatingBadgeHtml`/`formatRatingSpanHtml` as `rating`, and that field's own logic guesses imdb-vs-tmdb from the id's shape -- every id on this grid is an imdb `tt...` id, so every badge came back `data-rating-type="imdb"`. This site forces IMDb-typed rating badges hidden unconditionally (`hide-badge-imdb-rating`, `23_client-list-management.js` -- only a TMDB-vs-none choice is a real setting here, IMDb ratings were never a feature), so the badge existed, had the right number, and rendered completely invisible. Confirmed live with an automated browser check against the deployed site before and after: 190 of 321 posters had a `.rating-badge` element with zero visible pixels. Fixed by handing the value over as `vote_average` instead, which both formatters treat as TMDB unconditionally, sidestepping the id-shape guess entirely.
- New regression test pins the exact call shape (`vote_average`, not `rating`) and separately confirms the buggy shape really does mislabel it -- the earlier tests for this feature only checked the fetch/cache logic and could not have caught this, since the DOM patch itself isn't observable in this repo's client test harness.

### ⭐ Remove duplicate items across lists

- New setting (Settings -> Duplicate Items Across Lists -> **Remove duplicate items across lists**): the config's top list (in the same top-to-bottom order shown in Catalogs/Live Preview & Editor, drag-to-reorder included) is left exactly as it is, and every list after it has whatever id an earlier same-type list already carries removed. A movie list is never deduped against a series list, since they never share an id in practice anyway.
- Applies in both places a person sees their catalogs: the builder's own **Live Preview & Editor** (`renderLivePreview`, `23_client-list-management.js`, applied client-side once every enabled shelf's sample has actually resolved -- comparing against an "earlier" shelf only means something once its own final answer is in) and the real Stremio/Nuvio catalogs once the install link is generated (`dedupeAcrossListEntries`, `05_catalog-core.js`, called from the `/catalog/:type/:id.json` route). Same rule, same order, in both places.
- Off by default, so every existing install keeps behaving exactly as it always has. Threaded through the full settings pipeline a toggle like this needs to survive: `collectKeys`/`buildConfig` (`23_client-list-management.js`), `/api/save`'s field allowlist, both `resolveConfig` decode paths and `decodeConfig` (`04_config-resolution.js`, `02_http-and-creator-utils.js`), the `/:config/configure` page, JSON backup export/restore, the config-changed hash used to detect an unsaved edit, and cross-device Creator Profile sync (`24_client-backup-restore-presets.js`, `22_client-creator-profile.js`) -- the same set of places `hideNonDigitalReleases`/`adultContentFilter` already had to be wired into, used here as the template.
- Same "same skip/page window" tradeoff the existing merged-row dedup (`fetchMergedCatalog`) already accepts: an earlier list is re-fetched at the same `skip` as the one being served rather than pulled in full, so this is exact for the common case (the home screen's first page of every row) and only approximate once someone pages deep into more than one row at once -- getting it exact deeper would mean holding every earlier list in full, which doesn't fit this add-on's stateless, one-request-per-page design.

### ⭐ Rating badges on Storylines, Sagas & Universes

- Both places this feature name appears now show a TMDB rating next to each poster's year, the same plain inline star-and-number every other poster tile in the app already uses (Discover's `loadPosterSlot`, `19_client-search-and-likes.js`): the Channel Builder's own **Storylines, Sagas & Universes** browse grid (`renderStorylinesUniverseList`, `20_client-channel-builder.js`) and the item details modal's **Storylines, Sagas & Universes** section (`renderItemStorylinesWatchOrder`, `19_client-search-and-likes.js`, next to each card's subtitle). The title already open in that modal is skipped -- its rating is already shown higher up on the same page.
- TV_CROSSOVER_EVENTS is a static, hand-curated registry (poster, title, year -- no rating baked in), so both surfaces resolve ratings live from `/api/details/batch`, deduplicated and cached at module scope (`resolveStorylineRatings`/`applyStorylineRatingBadges`, `20_client-channel-builder.js`) so the two pages, a title appearing in more than one saga, and switching category tabs, all share one lookup per id for the whole session rather than re-asking.

### ⭐ Specials, alongside a show's regular seasons

- **Channel Builder**: browsing a show's seasons to add episodes to a channel (`/api/show-seasons`, `25_api-catalog-routes.js`) now lists that show's Specials (TMDB season 0) as its own season button, after every numbered season, instead of dropping it silently. "Add every season" picks it up too. The three automated bulk builders that also start from a show list — Quick Add network channels, the Quick Channel Wizard, and a Spotlight actor's whole filmography (`buildChannelItemsFromShows`, `20_client-channel-builder.js`) — still leave Specials out on their own, since an unattended channel full of recaps and clip shows plays badly; a person who wants them can still add them by hand from the season picker.
- **Item details modal**: clicking a poster to view a show's page (`openItemDetailsModal`, `19_client-search-and-likes.js`) now shows a Specials season card below all of the show's regular seasons, rather than skipping it.

### 🐛 New on Streaming: episode bumps could never reach most of the catalog

- **A show's episode/season bump could get permanently stuck at its original arrival date, falling further and further behind MDBList's dates**: `bumpNewOnStreamingEpisodes` (`07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`) selected which active series to re-check against TMDB with `ORDER BY last_event_at DESC LIMIT 50` — the 50 shows checked *most recently*. That selection is self-reinforcing: a show not chosen this tick has (by definition) an older `last_event_at` than the 50 that were, so it is even less likely to be chosen next tick, and once more than 50 other series are more recently active it can never be selected again — the exact reproduction is now `tests/new-on-streaming.test.mjs`'s *"still checks and bumps a series buried past the old top-50-by-recency window"*. Since this job runs on every cron tick (every 6 minutes, `wrangler.toml`) rather than being gated like the RapidAPI sweep, that ceiling was crossed almost immediately in practice, silently freezing most of the catalog's episode/season bumps while the same already-fresh 50 shows kept getting re-checked. This is what left *A Love Other Than Yours* dated by its original Sep 13 arrival on this site while [mdblist.com/new-on-streaming/](https://mdblist.com/new-on-streaming/) correctly showed it bumped to Sep 19 for its new episode.
- Replaced the selection with a rotating `OFFSET` cursor, persisted in KV (`cron:newonstreaming:bumpcursor:<region>`, same pattern as the sweep's own `cron:newonstreaming:lastsweep`) and ordered by the stable `imdb_id` key rather than the ever-shifting `last_event_at`, so every active series is walked and re-checked in turn instead of the same top 50 being re-selected forever. The cursor advances by exactly how many rows were actually TMDB-checked that tick (not by the wider fetched batch), so a small budget — such as the Admin dashboard's manual "sweep now" bump — defers rows to the next call rather than skipping them outright.
- **RapidAPI's own episode/season feed — the correct, real-time source for these bumps — was structurally under-fetching, which is the deeper reason the TMDB fallback above was needed at all**: RapidAPI's `/changes` endpoint returns only 25 changes per page, and a regular sweep never pages past its per-type budget (no cursor continuation once that tick's allocation runs out — confirmed against the API's own `openapi.yaml`). With `NEW_ON_STREAMING_MAX_PAGES_PER_SWEEP = 3` split ~70/20/10 across show/episode/season, a regular tick fetched exactly one 25-item page of `episode` changes per 4-hour window — easily outpaced by real episode-arrival volume across all 8 tracked services. Raised the per-sweep budget to 4 pages and gave a **regular** (non-backfill) tick its own split — 25% show / 50% episode / 25% season (1/2/1 pages) — so `episode` gets a second page (50 items/tick instead of 25) where the real ceiling was, while a backfill (`reset`/`full`) keeps the original show-heavy 70/20/10 split since it is reconstructing catalog history rather than catching today's drops. Monthly RapidAPI usage rises from ~720/month to ~900/month (180 sweeps × 5 requests), staying under the 950 safety cap.

### 🐛 Quick Add channels: install link "too large to save" after adding several networks

- **Adding several "Quick Add Popular Networks" channels (CBS, NBC, ABC, HBO, ...) could push a config's install link past the 10 MB save ceiling ("Cloud storage save failed (That configuration is too large to save)"), falling back to a giant base64 URL long enough to fail installing in apps with URL-length limits**: `quickAddChannel` (`20_client-channel-builder.js`) already had a small, server-cached preset to add from (`/api/channel-preset`, capped at 200 episodes across a network's top 10 shows) — but its gate for "is this preset good enough to use" compared the preset's item count against `CHANNEL_POOL_MAX_ITEMS` (5000), a number a 200-item preset can never reach. That comparison was always false, so Quick Add always fell through to building the channel live in the browser instead, with no cap of its own (`CHANNEL_POOL_MAX_ITEMS` again, this time as the *actual* ceiling on the client-side builder, which pulled every episode of every show TMDB returned for that network — easily thousands). Ten such channels in one config was enough to blow past `SAVED_CONFIG_BYTES_MAX`. Fixed by comparing against a real bar (`CHANNEL_PRESET_MIN_ITEMS = 20`) instead, so Quick Add actually uses the small cached preset it already had.
- **"Can these be prebuilt daily so a click adds instantly?"**: the preset cache above was already 24h-TTL'd but populated lazily — whoever clicked a given network first each day paid for the live TMDB build (discover the network's top 10 shows, then up to 3 seasons of episodes each). Extracted that build into a shared function (`buildNetworkChannelPreset`, `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`) used by both the route and a new cron task, `prewarmChannelPresets`, that refreshes one of the 28 Quick Add networks (`CHANNEL_PRESET_NETWORKS`, `00_constants.js`) per 6-minute tick — the full set cycles in a few hours, comfortably inside the 24h cache window, so a real click is served from a warm cache rather than triggering a build.
- New tests: `tests/channel-preset.test.mjs` covers the warm-cache/cold-build/fallback-network paths on `/api/channel-preset`, the cron prewarm's per-tick rotation, a Quick Add click making zero TMDB requests once the prewarm has run, and a source-text regression guard against the old unreachable gate coming back.
- **Follow-up: restored the full 5,000-episode rotating pool (24 shows x 3 episodes/day) without reopening the size bug the fix above closed.** The 200-episode cap was a deliberate trade-off at the time — small enough to embed directly in a saved config without risk — but it meant a Quick Add channel had far less to rotate through than before. Raised `buildNetworkChannelPreset`'s pool back to `CHANNEL_POOL_MAX_ITEMS` (5,000, now a server-side constant in `00_constants.js` alongside the client's own copy) and its show discovery from one page (10 shows) to up to `CHANNEL_PRESET_DISCOVER_PAGES` (10 pages, ~200 candidate shows) so a popular network actually has enough material to approach that cap — cheaply, since `assembleFromShows` already stops issuing new requests the moment the pool is full. The pool itself now lives *only* in the shared `channel:preset:v2:<networkId>` KV cache (up to a few MB, comfortably under KV's 25MB value limit); `quickAddChannel` saves a tiny `{presetNetworkId, channelId, poster, backdrop, ...}` pointer into the catalog row instead of the pool, and `channelSourceItems` (`05_catalog-core.js`) resolves that pointer back to the full pool from the cache at the moment a channel's real episode list is actually needed (streaming, or opening it in Stremio) — `fetchChannelCatalog`'s catalog-tile listing never needs to, since the pointer carries its own poster/backdrop. Ten Quick Add channels' worth of pointer rows now total under 2KB combined, regardless of how large each one's underlying pool is.
- New tests in `tests/channel-preset.test.mjs`: multi-page TMDB discovery and the 5,000-item cap (proving the pool is no longer capped at 200), `channelSourceItems` resolving a pointer to its full cached pool, `buildChannelMeta` serving real episodes for a pointer-based channel with zero TMDB calls, `fetchChannelCatalog` rendering a pointer channel's tile with no KV access at all, and the actual regression check — ten pointer rows saving successfully under `/api/save` instead of hitting the size ceiling.
- **Second follow-up, caught from live use: a Quick Add channel with an empty-items pointer showed "0 episodes" in My Channels, and opening it showed "That URL isn't a supported list source."** The pointer above shipped with no `items` at all, on the theory that `channelSourceItems` would always resolve the real pool server-side. That missed something real: a long list of OTHER places in this codebase read a channel row's own `.items` directly as a local shortcut, entirely independent of that server resolution — `ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows`/`renderMyCreatedChannelsList` (the "My Channels" list, which rebuilds a channel's local record from its row whenever this browser's own copy is missing) and `openListDetailsPage`'s local-preview path ("See All", `23_client-list-management.js`) among them. An empty-items pointer left every one of those constructing a broken 0-episode channel the moment this browser's local copy was not available — which is exactly what happens once several 5,000-item channels together exceed what `saveLocalChannelsMap`'s own quota fallback can fit in this browser's `localStorage`, a real and not even rare scenario now that the pool is back to 5,000. "See All" then fell through to `/api/preview`, which was never built to serve a channel's full episode list (it returns the channel's own single catalog tile) — hence the misleading "not a supported list source" message.
  - Fixed by giving the pointer a real, small `CHANNEL_POINTER_SAMPLE_ITEMS` (50) sample of its own alongside `presetNetworkId`, restoring the "a channel row is never truly empty" invariant every one of those call sites already depended on — about 20KB/channel, 200KB for ten of them, nowhere near `SAVED_CONFIG_BYTES_MAX`. `channelSourceItems` still always prefers the full server-cached pool when it can reach it, falling back to this sample only if that resolution itself fails.
  - New tests in `tests/client.test.mjs` (*"a Quick Add channel row stays usable without its local copy"*): `quickAddChannel` saves a non-empty sample alongside its pointer (while the local "My Channels" copy still gets the full pool), and `ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows` reconstructs a real (non-zero) local record from a pointer row when this browser never had a local copy at all.
  - Also fixed a real render break this introduced along the way: a backtick inside a code comment in `20_client-channel-builder.js` (a client file, embedded verbatim inside `renderBuilder`'s own template literal in `09_page-shell.js`) corrupted the served builder page entirely. `render_check.js`/`html_checks.py` (this repo's CI) catch exactly this, and now pass again — worth remembering for any future comment in a `09_`-`24_` client file: no backticks.
- **Third follow-up: after the 5,000-item pool restoration shipped, some Quick Add networks (FX, FOX, Food Network) kept serving their old 200-episode preset while others (History, HGTV, HBO, Hallmark) already had the new full pool.** This isn't a bug in the fix itself — `prewarmChannelPresets` only refreshes one of the 28 `CHANNEL_PRESET_NETWORKS` per 6-minute cron tick, so a network built under the old 200-cap keeps serving that stale `channel:preset:v2:<networkId>` cache entry (24h TTL) until the rotation naturally reaches it again, which can take hours. There was no way to see which networks were still stale or force one to rebuild without waiting.
  - Added an admin **Channel Presets** tab (Management & Tools → Channel Presets, `03_admin.js`) that lists all 28 networks with their cache status, live episode count, and how long ago each was last built (`builtAt`, a new field on the cached payload set by `buildNetworkChannelPreset`), plus per-row "Rebuild" and "Clear" actions and a "Clear all caches" button.
  - Backing routes in `26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`: `GET /admin/api/channel-presets` (status for all networks), `POST /admin/api/channel-presets/clear` (`{networkId}` or `{all:true}`, deletes the cached preset(s) so the next Quick Add click or the next prewarm tick rebuilds them fresh), and `POST /admin/api/channel-presets/rebuild` (`{networkId}`, calls `buildNetworkChannelPreset` with `forceRebuild: true` immediately rather than waiting for the cron rotation).
  - New tests in `tests/channel-preset.test.mjs` (*"admin: Channel Presets tab"*): auth is required on all three routes, status reporting reflects cached/uncached and item counts correctly, single-network and clear-all both remove the right KV entries, rebuild produces a fresh `builtAt` and updated item count, and an unknown `networkId` is rejected on both clear and rebuild.
- **Fourth follow-up: even after the admin tab above confirmed every network's KV cache was fully rebuilt, freshly Quick-Added channels in a real browser still landed at exactly 200 episodes for some networks and exactly 50 for others — a *different* stale set than the cron-rotation staleness above, and inconsistent from browser to browser.** The real cause was a second, independent cache the admin tab's Clear/Rebuild buttons never touched: the `/api/channel-preset` route (`25_api-catalog-routes.js`) was serving its response with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, s-maxage=86400`, and `quickAddChannel`'s `fetch()` call (`20_client-channel-builder.js`) had no `cache: 'no-store'` to override it (every sibling fetch in the same function already sets that). `public` + `s-maxage` makes a response eligible for shared/CDN caching, not just this browser's own HTTP cache, so whatever this exact `networkId`+`name` URL had returned — including a build from long before the pool was raised to `CHANNEL_POOL_MAX_ITEMS`, or a build from partway through this fix's own rollout — could keep being replayed verbatim for up to 24 hours, regardless of what the KV cache underneath had moved on to. An admin "Rebuild" fixes the KV entry instantly; it can't reach a copy already sitting in someone's browser or a shared cache. Changed the route to `Cache-Control: no-store` (the KV cache this route reads from is already the caching layer — a second, day-long cache on top of it only worked against every fix above) and added `cache: 'no-store'` to the client fetch for defense in depth.
- **Fifth follow-up: signed-in accounts kept seeing a *third*, independent cause of the same symptom — a deleted channel could reappear on its own, and a channel could quietly drop from its real item count back down to 50 with no action taken.** Signed-in browsers roam their "My Channels" state across devices through a separate cloud sync path (`pushChannelsSync`/`loadCreatorSync`, `22_client-creator-profile.js`) that neither of the fixes above touches. Two bugs compounded here:
  - `pushChannelsSync` uploads this browser's *entire* local channels map — full item arrays included — to `/api/creator/sync/save-channels`, which has always enforced its own 24MB cap on that blob (`26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`). A handful of Quick Add channels at up to 5,000 items each crosses that easily, and the save then fails outright — silently: `pushChannelsSync` has no error path for `data.ok === false`, so a delete or a newly added channel could sit forever as an unsynced local-only change with no indication anything was wrong.
  - Worse, `loadCreatorSync` adopted `synced.channels` from the server **unconditionally**, with no "is this actually newer" check the way the catalog-row `config` already had (`configChanged`). So the very next pull — a background poll, a tab switch, a plain reload — would overwrite this device's local channels with whatever stale copy the server was still holding, silently undoing a delete that hadn't synced yet, or reverting a channel's real item count back down to whatever smaller snapshot last made it through (a 50-item pointer sample if `ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows` had ever had to rebuild that channel from its row on some earlier, unrelated occasion).
  - Fixed three ways. `channelsForCloudSync` (new, `22_client-creator-profile.js`) slims any channel carrying `presetNetworkId` down to the same small sample its catalog row pointer already carries before it goes up — that pool already lives durably in the shared `channel:preset:v2:<networkId>` cache, so it never needed a second per-account copy, and the cloud blob now stays small regardless of how many Quick Add channels an account has. (`presetNetworkId` now rides on the full local copy too, not just the row's pointer — `quickAddChannel`/`saveLocalChannel`/`ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows`, `20_client-channel-builder.js` — so `channelsForCloudSync` has something to recognize.) `loadCreatorSync` now only adopts `synced.channels`/`synced.mergedChannels` when `channelsUpdatedAt` is genuinely newer than what this device already knew (the same `priorServerTrackingUpdatedAt` pattern the tracking merge already used), so a stale or unchanged server stamp can no longer overwrite this device's own more recent local state. And since the slimming above means a synced-down Quick Add channel can legitimately be thin now, `renderMyCreatedChannelsList` calls a new `resolveThinPresetChannels` at the end of every render: any local channel with `presetNetworkId` and an item count at or under the sample size gets quietly re-fetched from `/api/channel-preset` (now warm from the KV cache, so this is cheap) and upgraded in place, preserving whatever the user had customized on it (`hideWatched`, story locks, publish state, rotation settings, ...) since the resolved payload is built by merging onto the existing local record, not replacing it.
  - New tests in `tests/client.test.mjs` (*"client: Quick Add channel cloud sync stays small, and never shrinks what's on screen"*): `channelsForCloudSync` slims a preset-backed channel while leaving a hand-built one untouched, `loadCreatorSync` rejects a same-or-older channels stamp but still adopts a genuinely newer one, and a thin preset-backed channel resolves back to its full pool without losing a customization.
- **Sixth follow-up: some channels stayed stuck at exactly 50 episodes even signed out, in a private window, and on the deploy carrying every fix above.** Signing out and going private ruled out cloud sync (the fifth follow-up) and stale HTTP responses (the fourth) in one move — neither one touches a signed-out, cache-empty session — which narrowed this to something purely local. The real cause: `ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows` (`20_client-channel-builder.js`, called at the top of every "My Channels" render) only ever builds a local record for a channel that has **none yet** — if a channel already has a local record, that branch never runs again for it, no matter what's missing from it. A record this function itself built under an *older* version of that branch (from before `presetNetworkId` existed on it — from anywhere earlier in this multi-round fix) is exactly such a case: it exists, so it's never revisited, and it has no `presetNetworkId` for `resolveThinPresetChannels` (the fifth follow-up's self-heal) to resolve against — so it skips that record on every single render, forever. A large-enough local channels map hitting this browser's storage limit and needing `ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows` to rebuild a missing record even once, at any point across this whole investigation, was enough to permanently poison that one channel. Fixed by having the existing-record branch also backfill `presetNetworkId` from the row's own pointer (which has always carried it) whenever a local record is missing it — the very next render's `resolveThinPresetChannels` can then find and actually repair it. New test in `tests/client.test.mjs`: *"backfills presetNetworkId onto a local record an older reconstruction already created without it"*.
- **Seventh follow-up: what editing a Quick Add channel does to all of the above.** Asked directly, since nothing up to this point had actually been checked against it — and two real problems turned up, one of them a regression from the fifth follow-up's own self-heal.
  - `resolveThinPresetChannels` could silently overwrite a deliberate edit. `channelSourceItems` (`05_catalog-core.js`) has always preferred `presetNetworkId`'s generic network lineup over a channel's own saved items, and `saveChannel` (the full editor's Save button) has always dropped `presetNetworkId` from the saved catalog row the moment a channel goes through it — nothing in that function's payload ever wrote the field back — so an edit already took effect for real playback correctly, even before this fix. What didn't follow along was the *local* copy: `saveLocalChannel`'s `presetNetworkId` fallback (added for the fifth follow-up) couldn't tell "the caller didn't mention this field" apart from "the caller explicitly cleared it," so it kept resurrecting the old value from the pre-edit record regardless of what `saveChannel` intended. Trim a Quick Add channel down to a small curated set (a very plausible edit — a top-10 favorites cut) and the local copy stayed tagged as preset-backed; the next "My Channels" render's `resolveThinPresetChannels` would see a small, tagged channel and quietly blow the curation away back to the full generic preset. Fixed by having `saveLocalChannel` check for the field's presence (`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`) rather than its truthiness, and by having `saveChannel` explicitly write `presetNetworkId: ''` (not just omit it) so that distinction actually reaches it.
  - `editChannel` (`20_client-channel-builder.js`) — the Edit button rendered inline on a catalog row itself, a different surface from the My Channels card's `editChannelById` — read that row's own saved payload and wrote it straight into the local channels map unconditionally. A Quick Add channel's row carries only its small pointer sample (`quickAddChannel`), so opening the editor from *this* button silently downgraded the local copy's real multi-thousand-item pool down to that sample, and hitting Save from there made the loss permanent. Fixed with the same "only create or improve, never downgrade" guard `ensureAllChannelsSyncedFromRows` already uses.
  - New tests in `tests/client.test.mjs`: *"editing and saving a preset-backed channel clears presetNetworkId, so a curated trim can never be overwritten back to the full preset"* and *"the catalog row's own Edit button never downgrades a richer local copy to the row's thin pointer sample"*.
  - Not fixed here, flagged as a known, pre-existing limitation unrelated to this investigation's regressions: opening a Quick Add channel in the full editor and saving without trimming its pool embeds the *entire* current item list directly into the saved catalog row (the editor has never used the pointer/sample pattern Quick Add itself uses) — large enough, this can still hit `SAVED_CONFIG_BYTES_MAX` and surface the original "That configuration is too large to save" error. Unlike everything else in this investigation, this fails loudly rather than silently, and affects hand-built channels the exact same way Quick Add ones edited this way are affected — it isn't unique to Quick Add and isn't something this session's fixes reopened.
- **Eighth follow-up: merging nine or more Quick Add channels into one combined catalog reopened the exact "That configuration is too large to save" error this entire investigation started from.** `quickAddChannel`'s own pointer discipline only ever protected *that* channel's own row at the moment it was first added — nothing else in the codebase that (re-)builds a channel's row was ever taught the same discipline, and the merge feature (`mergeChannelsIntoRow`, `toggleMergedChannelInCatalog`, `addChannelToMerge`, `removeChannelFromMerge`, `pruneChannelFromAllMerges`) always embedded each member's *full* local copy — five to nine 5,000-item pools concatenated into one row blew straight through the 10MB ceiling. The same gap existed in every other place a channel gets (re-)added to Catalogs outside of Quick Add itself: `toggleChannelInCatalog` (the My Channels card's own +Add/Remove), `undoChannelDelete`, `acceptSharedChannel`, and `addDirectoryChannel` all had the identical bug waiting for anyone who removed and re-added, restored, or imported a still-preset-backed channel. Fixed with one shared `channelRowUrl(channel)` helper (`20_client-channel-builder.js`) — the same pointer-sample logic `quickAddChannel` already had, generalized: any channel still carrying `presetNetworkId` gets slimmed to its `CHANNEL_POINTER_SAMPLE_ITEMS` sample when its row is built, a hand-built or already-edited channel (see the seventh follow-up — editing clears the tag) is embedded exactly as before. Every one of the call sites above now routes through it instead of `JSON.stringify`-ing the channel directly. New tests in `tests/client.test.mjs`: *"channelRowUrl slims a preset-backed channel's row, and leaves a hand-built one's alone"* and *"merging several full-pool Quick Add channels stays small, instead of reopening the too-large-to-save ceiling"* (the exact reported scenario — nine 5,000-item channels merged into one row, asserting every member's line carries only its sample and the combined row stays under 200KB).

## [1.5.5] - 2026-09-20

### 🐛 Trakt Airing Next: item counts, badges and slow search

- **Live Preview & Editor showed more Trakt Airing Next items than Trakt actually has, and a different count than "My Lists"**: the Continue Watching (series) and Airing Next shelves merged the live `/api/preview` sample with a client-cached "My Lists" sample by union — adding whatever either side had that the other lacked. That let an unconfirmed or already-aired candidate leak in from the cache, and let a show the live fetch had (but "My Lists" did not) inflate the count past what "My Lists" showed for the same list. `renderLivePreview` (`23_client-list-management.js`) now prefers the cached "My Lists" sample outright whenever one is available, falling through to the live sample only when nothing is cached yet.
- **Rating badges appeared on some Airing Next tiles and not others**: the live fetch (`fetchTraktAiringNext`, `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`) never carried a rating at all — only cache-sourced items did — so which tiles got a star badge came down to which source happened to supply that item. Added `extended=full` to the Trakt calendar fetch, the same query param `mapTraktItems` already reads `show.rating` from for every other Trakt list this add-on fetches (same request, no extra cost).
- **Badges wrong or missing throughout the site**: the client-side `getAiringNextIndex()`/`findAiringMatchFor()` lookup used for badge matching keyed shows by `id.split(':')[0]`, which collapses every `tmdb:`-prefixed show to the literal string `"tmdb"` — the same normalisation bug already fixed server-side (DB-002/BE-002) via `trackingShowKey`. Reimplemented that fix locally in `23_client-list-management.js`.
- **Empty personal shelves cluttered Live Preview**: Continue Watching, Watchlist, Watch History and Airing Next rows now hide themselves while genuinely empty instead of showing a "No items found." block, and reappear the moment the account has something in them again — no change to the shelf's own config.
- **Search sometimes took a long time to load**: `/api/title-search` fired a live, uncapped, timeout-less per-result Cinemeta poster lookup for every result missing a TMDB poster — up to ~100 outbound requests gating one response. The client already resolves a missing poster itself after rendering (`resolveMissingPostersInDom` → `/api/poster-fallback`), so the eager server-side lookup was removed, and the route's remaining external calls now use the existing `fetchWithTimeout` wrapper so one slow provider response can no longer stall the whole search.

### 🐛 Trakt Continue Watching & Airing Next Live Preview Fixes

- **Trakt Continue Watching Movie vs Series Isolation**:
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, strictly validated `isMovie` (`!isEp && (it.type === "movie" || !!it.movie)`) in `fetchTraktContinueWatching` when `entry.type === "movie"`. Show entities can no longer fall through as movies.
  - In `23_client-list-management.js`, ensured `getFallbackShelfSample()` respects shelf type (`s.type === 'movie'` filters out all series items; `s.type === 'series'` filters out all movie items). Empty movie catalogs no longer fall back to displaying TV shows from `_myPrivateTraktLists`.
  - For series shelves, merged all known continue watching series from private Trakt lists so that all in-progress and up-next series display consistently.
- **Trakt Airing Next 12-Show Live Preview Completeness**:
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, expanded `fetchTraktAiringNext` to query 4 consecutive 33-day calendar segments in parallel (covering 132 days / ~4.5 months) rather than just the immediate 33 days.
  - In `23_client-list-management.js`, merged server preview samples with the user's client-enriched 12-show cache (`myListAddon:traktAiringNextCache` / `_myPrivateTraktLists`), ensuring all 12 upcoming airing shows display in Live Preview sorted by air date.
- **Trakt Continue Watching Preview Reliability**:
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, made `/sync/playback` safe against HTTP 404 or empty playback states. Only authentication errors (HTTP 401/403) or rate limits (HTTP 429) raise errors. If no active scrobbles exist, it continues to compute up-next unwatched episodes.
  - Sliced progress lookup candidate series to 15 (from 40) in `fetchTraktContinueWatching` to stay strictly within Cloudflare Workers' 50 subrequest limit.
  - Multi-keyed `seenShowIds` across `trakt`, `imdb`, `tmdb`, and `slug` so unwatched series progress properly excludes active playback shows.
- **Preview Route (`/api/preview`) Subrequest Protection & Error Transparency**:
  - In `25_api-catalog-routes.js`, capped TMDb rating enrichment on preview samples to the first 12 items (`sampleMetas.slice(0, 12)`), preventing subrequest exhaustion when sample size is up to 100.
  - Preserved underlying error messages in `/api/preview` catch block (`(err && err.message) || "Couldn't load that list."`).

### ⭐ Simkl Airing Next Removal, MDBList Up Next & Trakt CW Badges, Trakt Attribution & Hidden Lists Scope

- **Simkl Airing Next Removal**:
  - Mini-poster tiles on **Simkl Airing Next** now render the red circle with the '✕' (`.cw-remove-btn`) matching all other lists.
  - Sample items in `openSimklAiringNextDetailsPage()` include `removeExternalProvider: 'simkl'`, `removeExternalTarget: 'status'`, and `removeExternalListId: it.status || 'watching'`.
  - In `25_api-catalog-routes.js`, `/api/external-list/item-mutate` routes Simkl list removals to `https://api.simkl.com/sync/remove-from-list`.
  - In `23_client-list-management.js`, `removeListItemFromDetails()` purges removed items from memory and `localStorage` cache (`myListAddon:simklAiringNextCache`).
- **MDBList Up Next & Trakt Continue Watching Badges & Settings**:
  - Render upcoming air dates, season premiere, and season finale badges on MDBList Up Next and Trakt Continue Watching preview tiles and details modals matching Dashboard Continue Watching.
  - Added toggle settings under **Settings &rarr; Poster Badges & Labels** (`showBadgesTraktContinueWatching` and `showBadgesMdblistUpNext`).
  - Added CSS body class hiding rules (`body.hide-trakt-continue-watching-badges` and `body.hide-mdblist-up-next-badges`) in `09_page-shell.js`.
  - Added badge resolution and `findAiringMatchFor` lookup in `renderMyMdblistLists`, `renderMyPrivateTraktLists`, `openMdblistUpNextDetailsPage`, and `openTraktContinueWatchingDetailsPage`.
- **Trakt Lists Creator Attribution**:
  - Trakt lists in "Your Trakt Lists" and Trakt list details modals now attribute `creatorName = 'Trakt'` (or user if `trakt.tv/users/<username>`) rather than defaulting to "My Lists Addon".
  - Passed `creatorName: 'Trakt'` explicitly in `openTraktContinueWatchingDetailsPage()` and `openTraktAiringNextDetailsPage()`, and attached `data-creator="Trakt"` to Trakt list cards in `renderMyPrivateTraktLists()`.
- **Hidden Lists Scope**:
  - Settings &rarr; Hidden Lists now enumerates all lists under "My Lists", including OAuth Trakt private lists (`_myPrivateTraktLists`), local custom lists, and connected provider lists.
  - `setListHidden()` immediately updates UI in memory and re-renders visible lists across tabs.
  - Added auto-fetch triggers and updated `renderHiddenListsSettingsSection()` hooks across provider list renderers.

### ✕ Remove Buttons on External Provider Static List Tiles

- Added red ✕ remove buttons to the mini-poster tiles on the **Your MDBList Lists** and **Your Trakt Lists** section cards that previously had no remove buttons.
  - **Trakt Continue Watching** tiles: button calls `provider=trakt`, `target=history` — removes the show from Trakt watch history.
  - **Trakt Airing Next** tiles: button calls `provider=trakt`, `target=watchlist` — removes the show from the Trakt watchlist.
  - **MDBList Up Next** tiles: button calls `provider=mdblist`, `target=watchlist` — removes the show from the MDBList watchlist.
  - **MDBList Airing Next** tiles: button calls `provider=mdblist`, `target=watchlist` — removes the show from the MDBList watchlist.
  - All buttons use the existing `cw-remove-btn` class, `data-remove-type="external"`, and `onclick="event.stopPropagation(); removeListItemFromDetails(this)"` pattern, routing through the proven `/api/external-list/item-mutate` endpoint.
  - Note: TMDB, Simkl (non-AiringNext), and slot-filled Trakt/MDBList cards (History, Watchlist, custom lists) already had remove buttons prior to this change — this only fills the remaining gaps.
- File changed: `17_client-my-lists-and-trakt-oauth.js` (four targeted insertions in `renderMyMdblistLists` and `renderMyPrivateTraktLists`). Rebuilt `worker_entry_combined.js` (3,927,962 bytes).

### ⭐ Trakt Continue Watching & Airing Next & MDBList Up Next Integration

- **Trakt Continue Watching & Airing Next**:
  - Integrated both active playback scrobbles (`GET https://api.trakt.tv/sync/playback?limit=50`) and recently watched series progress (`GET https://api.trakt.tv/users/me/watched/shows?extended=noseasons` + `GET https://api.trakt.tv/shows/:id/progress/watched?last_activity=watched&hidden=false&specials=false&count_specials=false`) in `/api/trakt-my-private-lists` (`25_api-catalog-routes.js`) and `fetchTraktContinueWatching` (`06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`).
  - Added exclusion for shows and movies that the user dropped or hid in Trakt by querying `/users/hidden/progress_watched`, `/users/hidden/dropped`, and `/users/hidden/progress_watched_reset` in parallel. Dropped titles are purged from Continue Watching, leaving only active in-progress shows and matching the Trakt.tv dashboard.
  - Added rate-limit protected concurrency (`mapWithConcurrency` with 5 concurrent requests) across Trakt progress lookups, preventing HTTP 429 rate-limiting from dropping active titles (*The Last of Us*, *Tracker*).
  - Fixed *FBI* miscalculation: Trakt's default `progress/watched` endpoint calculated `next_episode` against the highest aired episode (`last_activity=aired`), returning unaired season premiere S09E01 *Rendition*. Added `last_activity=watched` query parameter and fallback scanning of `prog.seasons` for the earliest uncompleted aired episode when `completed < aired`, properly returning S01E02 (*Green Birds*).
  - Preserved **Trakt Airing Next**'s working candidate and client TMDB enrichment pipeline in `17_client-my-lists-and-trakt-oauth.js` and `25_api-catalog-routes.js`, ensuring all candidate shows populate and enrich with upcoming dates and premiere badges via `localStorage` cache and `enrichTraktAiringNextDates()`.
  - In `04_config-resolution.js`, mapped `trakt:continue-watching`, `trakt:continue-watching:*`, and `trakt:user:continue-watching` to `"trakt-continue-watching"`.
  - In `05_catalog-core.js`, wired `fetchCatalog` to dispatch `"trakt-continue-watching"` to `fetchTraktContinueWatching()`.
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, implemented `fetchTraktContinueWatching()`, supporting filtering by series/episodes or movies, live playback progress percentages, and Stremio catalog streams.
  - In `17_client-my-lists-and-trakt-oauth.js`, updated `renderMyPrivateTraktLists` to render preview poster tiles with active playback progress bars, quick count overlay, "+ Add" to Stremio Catalogs (adds both Movies and Shows as mixed catalog), and `openTraktContinueWatchingDetailsPage()` modal.
- **MDBList Up Next, Watch History Removal & Poster Normalization**:
  - Added automatic query to MDBList's Up Next API (`GET https://api.mdblist.com/upnext?limit=50&hide_unreleased=true&append_to_response=poster`) in `/api/mdblist-my-lists` (`25_api-catalog-routes.js`). When a user connects their MDBList account, their currently watched shows with next unwatched episodes are returned at the top of "Your MDBList Lists" as **MDBList Up Next**.
  - Fixed MDBList Watch History removal error (`Could Not Remove From MDBLIST: API Endpoint Not Found`): standardized MDBList Watch History card URL to `mdblist:history` in `/api/mdblist-my-lists` (`25_api-catalog-routes.js`), updated `19_client-search-and-likes.js` and `23_client-list-management.js` to recognize all variations of MDBList history URLs (`mdblist:history` and `https://mdblist.com/history/...`) as `target: 'history'` (preventing them from mistakenly being treated as custom lists and posting to non-existent `/lists/.../items/remove` endpoints), and fortified `/api/external-list/item-mutate` to target MDBList's `/sync/watched/remove`, `/sync/watched`, and `/history/remove` endpoints. Recompiled `worker_entry_combined.js` and verified byte-exact sync.
  - Fixed broken card preview posters on MDBList Up Next: normalized relative TMDB poster paths (e.g., `/xxx.jpg` -> `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xxx.jpg`), added Metahub poster fallback (`https://images.metahub.space/poster/medium/${showId}/img`) across server routes and client list renderers.
  - Added `resolveListCardItemPoster(it)` and `onerror="handlePosterImgError(this)"` with `data-imdb` and `data-title` to mini-poster tiles in `17_client-my-lists-and-trakt-oauth.js` for both MDBList Up Next and Trakt Continue Watching.
  - In `04_config-resolution.js`, mapped `mdblist:upnext`, `mdblist:upnext:*`, and `mdblist:user:shows:upnext` to `"mdblist-upnext"`.
  - In `05_catalog-core.js`, wired `fetchCatalog` to dispatch `"mdblist-upnext"` to `fetchMdblistUpNext()`.
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, updated `extractMdblistItem()` to parse and retain `next_episode` metadata, and implemented `fetchMdblistUpNext()` to serve series catalogs with upcoming/next episode details.
  - In `17_client-my-lists-and-trakt-oauth.js`, updated `renderMyMdblistLists` to render preview poster tiles with next episode badges, quick count overlay, "+ Add" to Stremio Catalogs (series), and `openMdblistUpNextDetailsPage()` modal.
  - In `23_client-list-management.js`, added `mdblist:upnext` and `trakt:continue-watching` to `isPersonalSentinel` to prevent invalid like actions on user-specific session shelves.

### ⭐ RapidAPI Streaming Availability Migration & Strict Quota Protection (1,000 req/mo)

- **Complete Transition to RapidAPI Streaming Availability API**:
  - Rebuilt New on Streaming on top of RapidAPI Streaming Availability API `GET /changes`, sorting strictly by actual streaming service arrival dates (`timestamp`), not original theatrical/broadcast release dates.
  - New movies and series enter the shelf ordered newest first.
  - Added automatic episode drop detection: when a new episode is released on a streaming service, the parent show's `last_event_at` is updated, pushing the series back to the top of the list.
  - Maintained a rolling 30-day window (`NEW_ON_STREAMING_WINDOW_DAYS = 30`), pruning events older than 30 days on each sweep.
  - Removed all legacy TMDB catalog sweep engine code (`newOnStreamingWalkPath`, `newOnStreamingCombos`, `readNewOnStreamingDepths`, `sweepTmdbNewOnStreaming`, `fetchNewOnStreamingLatestEpisode`, `lookupNewOnStreamingKnown`, etc.) and associated TMDB sweep constants.
  - Sweeps now strictly require `RAPIDAPI_KEY` (configured via Cloudflare secret) and no longer fall back to TMDB.
- **Strict Quota Protection & 4-Hour Automated Cadence**:
  - Designed specifically for the RapidAPI Basic Plan (1,000 requests/month hard limit, 1,000 requests/hour rate limit, 10,240 MB/month bandwidth limit).
  - Enforced a KV-tracked monthly request counter (`cron:rapidapi:usage`) with a hard safety cutoff at 950 requests (`RAPIDAPI_MONTHLY_SAFETY_CAP = 950`), completely halting automated and manual sweeps before any overage fees can occur.
  - Automated cron sweeps run on a 4-hour interval cooldown (`NEW_ON_STREAMING_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 14400`), totaling ~6 runs/day (~180 runs/month). With 1-2 pages per run (~180-360 calls/month), usage stays well below the 950 safety cap.
  - Manual admin sweeps bypass the 4-hour interval cooldown for on-demand testing while still honoring the 950 safety cap.
  - Added support for clearing all existing items and pulling fresh data from RapidAPI across the full 30-day window (`reset: true` / `clear: true`), accessible via the new **"Clear & pull fresh data"** button on the Admin dashboard.
  - Admin dashboard New on Streaming tab displays live monthly request consumption (`count / 1,000`, remaining allowance, safety cap status), last sweep timestamps, and next scheduled runs.
- **MDBList Parity & Sweep Engine Hardening**:
  - **Service Monetization Suffix Normalization**: Fixed `newOnStreamingProvider` and `normalizeNewOnStreamingServiceKey` to strip `.subscription` and other monetization suffixes. RapidAPI returns `prime.subscription`, `apple.subscription`, `max.subscription`, etc., which previously caused Prime Video and Apple TV+ titles to fail the database query filter and be omitted from the catalog.
  - **Multi-Type Sweep Coverage (Show, Season, Episode)**: Added `season` changes to the sweep engine alongside `show` and `episode`. When a streaming service drops a new season or a new episode of an existing show, the show's `last_event_at` is updated, pushing the series back to the top of the shelf on that date.
  - **Proportional Budget Allocation & Quota Rollover**: Replaced greedy page consumption with fair multi-type budget allocation (1 page each for `show`, `season`, and `episode` on 3-page cron ticks; ~50% show, ~15% season, ~35% episode on deep backfills) with automatic rollover of unused quota so episodes and seasons are never starved.
  - **Deep Reset & Backfill Default**: Increased default sweep pages on resets from 3 to 30 pages (up to 750 items) with a 50-page maximum in Admin, allowing full 30-day historical coverage across all 8 major streaming services.
  - **Show ID Fallback**: Added `tmdbId` fallback for `imdbId` in `processRapidApiStreamingChanges` to avoid dropping items that only carry TMDB identifiers.
  - **Digital Store Exclusion (SVOD vs TVOD/Rent/Buy)**: Excluded transactional digital store purchases and rentals (e.g. iTunes Store / Amazon Video buy/rent) by filtering out `streamingOptionType === "rent" || streamingOptionType === "buy"` and removing bare `apple` and `prime` from `NEW_ON_STREAMING_DEFAULT_CATALOGS`. Previously, querying bare `apple` flooded the catalog with dozens of digital purchase releases from iTunes (like Agatha Christie films and iTunes buy drops), which overwrote true streaming subscription premiere dates (e.g. *Golden Axe* premiered on Paramount+ on Sep 16, but an iTunes digital store purchase entry on Sep 18 was mistakenly overwriting it as an Apple TV+ show).
  - **Unscripted Daily Television Exclusion (Talk Shows, News, Game Shows)**: Filtered out unscripted daily broadcast television (e.g. *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*, *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, *The Today Show*, *World News Tonight*, *Wheel of Fortune*, *Jeopardy!*, and genres `news`, `talk-show`, `game-show`). Daily broadcast networks (especially Peacock and Hulu) release hundreds of episodes per day that flooded the feed and pushed out actual scripted series and movie releases (such as Netflix drops like *A Parasite's Heart* and *Unlucky Bae*). This matches MDBList's exclusion of daily unscripted TV.
  - **Increased Manual Backfill Page Capacity (up to 100 Pages)**: Raised the maximum pages for manual sweeps in the Admin Dashboard from 50 to 100 pages and adjusted multi-type budget allocation (45% show, 10% season, 45% episode). This allows deeper historical backfills across the 30-day window without running out of pages during high-activity periods, while remaining strictly protected by the 950-request monthly safety cap.
  - **Fail-Safe Deferred Table Reset**: Deferred the table purge (`DELETE FROM streaming_events`) during "Clear & pull fresh data" until after the first valid page of new data arrives from RapidAPI, preventing an empty database in the event of upstream API errors.
  - **Automated TMDB Episode Air-Date Bumping (`bumpNewOnStreamingEpisodes`)**: Restored automated episode air-date detection for active streaming series in `streaming_events` against TMDB's TV API. When an episode airs (such as Episode 5 of *A Parasite's Heart* on Sep 18), the show's `last_event_at`, `season`, and `episode` are updated, pushing the series to the top of the shelf on its exact episode air date to match MDBList's Release Date cataloging.
  - **Multi-Key Indexing & Clean TMDB ID Normalization**: Fixed `processRapidApiStreamingChanges` to index shows in `showsMap` across all identifiers (`id`, `imdbId`, `tmdbId`, and numeric IDs). If a show lacks an IMDb ID, its TMDB ID is cleaned to a standard integer format (`tmdb:324931`) rather than retaining provider prefixes (`tmdb:series/324931`), ensuring seamless compatibility with Stremio, Metahub posters, and Cinemeta.
  - **Sweep Budget Rebalancing & 150-Unit Manual Limit**: Shifted the multi-type sweep budget to 70% `show`, 20% `episode`, and 10% `season` so sweeps reach back 7–10 days across all 8 major streaming services instead of exhausting their budget in ~2 days on daily broadcasts. Raised the manual sweep limit from 50 to 150 units in `26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`.
  - **Direct Title Add / Sync Tool (`/admin/api/new-on-streaming/add`)**: Added an admin tool in the New on Streaming tab to add or sync any movie or series directly into `streaming_events` by IMDb ID (e.g. `tt45851964`), TMDB ID (e.g. `324931`), or title name (*A Parasite's Heart*). Automatically retrieves TMDB metadata, posters, and recent episode air dates.
  - **Admin Preview Search & Pagination**: Added real-time title/ID search filtering and Prev/Next pagination buttons to the Admin New on Streaming preview panel, allowing administrators to search the entire database and page through up to 100 items per page instead of being capped at the top 60 items.
  - **Admin Auto-Refresh**: Updated the Admin dashboard to automatically reload the live preview table upon completion of any sweep.
- **Unified Chronological Preview & MDBList Visual Parity**:
  - Added support for unified chronological viewing across both movies and shows (`type=all` or `type=mixed`) in `fetchNewOnStreaming` (`07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`) and `/admin/api/new-on-streaming/preview` (`26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`).
  - Added `<option value="all" selected>All (Movies & Shows)</option>` to the Admin New on Streaming preview dropdown, allowing administrators to view movies and shows interleaved chronologically exactly like [mdblist.com/new-on-streaming/](https://mdblist.com/new-on-streaming/).
  - Enriched catalog items with streaming service metadata (`service`, `services`), media type (`type`: `movie` vs `series`), and arrival timestamp (`addedAt`).
  - Enhanced the Admin preview table (`03_admin.js`) with dedicated columns for **Type** (color-coded Show/Movie badges), **Service** (streaming provider badges like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video), and **Added Date** (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

### ⭐ Self-Service Account Recovery: Set/Update Recovery Answer & Forgot Username

- **Add / Update Recovery Answer for Existing Accounts**:
  - Added authenticated endpoint `POST /api/creator/recovery-answer` (`26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`) allowing existing creators to add or update their recovery answer after signup.
  - Enforces `RECOVERY_ANSWER_MIN_LENGTH` (8+ characters) and hashes with PBKDF2 (`hashCreatorKey`).
  - Updates both D1 `creators.recovery_answer_hash` and KV `creator:${username}`.
  - Added dedicated **Account Recovery** card to Creator Settings in `renderAccountKeySection()` (`22_client-creator-profile.js`), displaying status badge (`✓ Configured` vs `⚠️ Not Set`) with modal `openSetRecoveryAnswerModal()` to set or update.
  - Updated `POST /api/creator/restore` and `authenticateCreator()` to return `hasRecoveryAnswer` boolean so the frontend immediately reflects status upon login.
- **Forgot Username Recovery Flow**:
  - Added self-service endpoint `POST /api/creator/forgot-username` (`26_api-creator-and-admin-routes.js`) allowing users who have their Account Key (`MYL-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`) and Recovery Answer (if set) to retrieve their username.
  - Built a fast deterministic SHA-256 blind index (`creatorKeyLookupHash`) mapping `keylookup:<hash>` -> `username` in KV and D1 `creator_key_lookups` (`migrations/0013_add_creator_key_lookups.sql`).
  - Added fallback scan for pre-migration accounts in D1 to verify key against `key_hash` and automatically backfill the lookup index.
  - Enforces per-IP rate limiting (`FORGOT_USERNAME_IP_MAX_FAILURES = 5` attempts per 15 minutes) and strict PBKDF2 verification against `key_hash` and `recovery_answer_hash`.
  - Added **"Forgot username?"** link to the Login dialog (`openRestoreProfileModal()`) in `22_client-creator-profile.js` opening `openForgotUsernameModal()`, which finds the username and offers a one-click "Login with this Username" action.
  - Updated key rotation (`/api/creator/reset-key` and `/admin/api/reset-creator-key`) and account deletion (`purgeCreatorData`) to keep the key lookup index in sync and prevent orphaned entries.
  - Updated `D1_SCHEMA_MANIFEST` in `00_constants.js` and `schema.sql` to include migration 0013.

### ⭐ Fix Missing Ratings on Discover Genres & Popular Lists

- **Popular Community Lists (MDBList & Trakt)**:
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, updated `extractMdblistItem(it)` to correctly parse the MDBList ratings array (`it.ratings: [{ source: "tmdb", value: 7.0 }]`), `score`, and `score_average`.
  - In `mapMdblistItems(data, type)`, fixed item reconstruction by including `vote_average` and `rating` (which were previously omitted from the returned object).
  - Added `&extended=full` to `fetchTrakt` list queries so Trakt returns item rating information.
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, updated `mapTraktItems` to preserve `tmdbId` and `imdbId` on mapped items, enabling downstream TMDb enrichment for Trakt items.
  - In `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, bumped `fetchMdblist` cache keys to `v3` to flush stale list entries cached before `tmdbId` pass-through. Added `&extended=full` to `fetchTraktWatchlist` and `fetchTraktHistory`.
  - In `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`, added `&extended=full` to `fetchTraktChart` and bumped cache keys to `v2` (`user_cache:trakt:chart:v2:` and `trakt:chart:v2:`), ensuring official Trakt charts (Trending, Popular, Most Played, etc.) receive full rating data from Trakt.
  - In `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`, added TMDb `/find` resolution for IMDb IDs (`tt...`) in `fetchTmdbDetails`.
  - In `25_api-catalog-routes.js`, enhanced `/api/preview` TMDb enrichment to resolve ratings via `m.imdbId` / `m.id` (`tt...`) when `tmdbId` is missing, and strengthened `effectiveTmdbKey` resolution.
  - In `16_client-row-core.js`, added `item.score` parsing fallback to `formatRatingBadgeHtml` and `formatRatingSpanHtml`.
- **Discover Genres Rating & Popularity Alignment**:
  - In `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`, updated `fetchTmdbGenre()`: standard genres (family, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, etc.) now sort by `popularity.desc&vote_count.gte=10` (or `vote_count.gte=5` for series) instead of `primary_release_date.desc`, surfacing top, popular, and well-rated titles rather than 0-vote titles releasing today.
  - Retained `primary_release_date.desc` sorting for `stream-releases`.
  - In `fetchTmdbGenre`, `fetchTmdbProviderTop10`, `fetchTmdbHiddenGems`, `fetchTmdbKids`, and `fetchTmdbHoliday`, passed full `details` into `mapTmdbItem`, ensuring `vote_average` is populated from detail lookups when omitted in upstream search results.
- **Client Cache Flushing on Refresh & Settings Toggle**:
  - In `16_client-row-core.js`, `renderDiscoverChartsList()` clears `_discoverFeedsCache[type]` and `_listPreviewCache` when `forceRefresh` is requested.
  - In `19_client-search-and-likes.js`, `loadPopularListsFeed(true)` clears cached popular list items and `_listPreviewCache`.
  - In `23_client-list-management.js`, `toggleTmdbRatingSetting()` invalidates `_discoverFeedsCache` so toggling ratings updates immediately.

### ⭐ TMDb Ratings Across All Pages & Removal of IMDb Ratings

- **Complete Removal of IMDb Ratings**:
  - Removed IMDb rating option entirely from Settings (`15_tab-settings-html.js`).
  - Replaced the radio selection group with a single clean checkbox toggle: **TMDb Ratings** (`#badgeTmdbRatingCheckbox`).
  - Added `toggleTmdbRatingSetting(isChecked)` in `23_client-list-management.js` and updated `setPosterRatingSource(source)` / `getPosterRatingSource()` to support only `'tmdb'` and `'none'`.
  - Set `hide-badge-imdb-rating` permanently on `<body>` via `applyBadgeBodyClasses()`, while `hide-badge-tmdb-rating` toggles based on the TMDb rating setting.
- **Universal TMDb Rating Display on All Pages**:
  - TMDb star ratings (`★ X.X`) display in subtitle rows across:
    - **Search**: `renderTitlePosterCards()` in `19_client-search-and-likes.js`.
    - **Discover**: 5-poster list preview cards (`loadPosterSlot`) and curated list preview cards (`buildCuratedListCardHtml`) in `19_client-search-and-likes.js`.
    - **Lists**: Custom lists (`buildCustomListCardHtml`), local lists / Watchlist / Watch History / Continue Watching (`buildLocalListCardHtml`), Airing Next (`buildAiringNextCardHtml`), and external TMDB user lists (`17_client-my-lists-and-trakt-oauth.js`).
    - **List Details ("See All" / Full Grids)**: `livePreviewPosterHtml()` in `23_client-list-management.js`.
  - Upstream data mapping in `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js` (`mapTmdbItem`, `mapSimklItems`) and `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js` (`extractMdblistItem`, `mapTraktItems`) now extracts and passes `vote_average` and `rating` through all catalog and details endpoints.
  - **Live Preview Shelves Exception Preserved**: Live Preview shelves on the My Catalogs tab remain strictly exempt from displaying ratings (`isLivePreviewShelf: true`).

### 🏷️ Untied Continue Watching Badges, Subtitle Ratings & Settings Clean-up

- **Untied Continue Watching Badges from Airing Next Removal**:
  - In `21_client-custom-list-builder.js`, updated `collectAiringNextCandidateShowIds()` to retain candidate show IDs for shows present in Continue Watching even if they are marked in `isAiringNextRemoved(id)`.
  - In `refreshAiringNext()`, cached all resolved upcoming show schedules in `window._airingNextScheduleMap` and persisted them in `localStorage ('myListAddon:airingScheduleMap')`.
  - Filtered removed shows strictly from the `airing-next` shelf items while updating `continue-watching` items directly with `airDate`, `seasonFinaleAirDate`, `isSeasonPremiere`, `isSeasonFinale`, and `seasonFinaleEpisodeNumber`.
  - In `23_client-list-management.js`, updated `getAiringNextIndex()` to include items from the schedule map, ensuring `findAiringMatchFor()` locates upcoming episode and finale dates even for shows removed from the Airing Next shelf.
  - In `22_client-creator-profile.js`, added fallback to `findAiringMatchFor()` in `buildLocalListCardHtml()` for Continue Watching.
- **Removed "Removed from Airing Next" Section from Settings**:
  - Removed the panel and its `#removedAiringNextSettingsSection` container from `15_tab-settings-html.js`.
  - Converted `renderRemovedAiringNextSettingsSection()` in `22_client-creator-profile.js` into a safe no-op. Shows automatically reappear on the Airing Next shelf when a user watches a newer episode.
- **Poster Ratings Moved to Subtitle Row with Single Active Toggle**:
  - Replaced checkboxes with a single-choice radio group (`posterRatingSource`: `None`, `IMDb Ratings`, `TMDb Ratings`) in Settings (`15_tab-settings-html.js`).
  - Added `getPosterRatingSource()` and `setPosterRatingSource(source)` in `23_client-list-management.js` to enforce mutual exclusivity across `None`, `IMDb`, and `TMDb`.
  - Implemented `formatRatingSpanHtml(item, options)` in `16_client-row-core.js` to render `<span class="poster-rating">★ X.X</span>` in the subtitle row beside the year (matching the user's screenshot) rather than overlaying chips on the poster artwork.
  - In `19_client-search-and-likes.js`, wired `renderTitlePosterCards()` to `formatRatingSpanHtml()`, allowing the Settings toggle to directly show or hide ratings in Search.
  - Removed `.rating-badge` overlay chips from `renderMediaCard()`, `buildAiringNextCardHtml()`, `buildLocalListCardHtml()`, and `livePreviewPosterHtml()`.
  - Maintained strict suppression of ratings on simulated Stremio shelves in Live Preview & Editor on the My Catalogs tab.

### 📺 Trakt Disconnected State, Channel Publishing, Share Modal Alignment & Builder Layout

- **Disconnected Trakt Prompt**:
  - Updated `runMyTraktLists()` to check for `token` before fetching. When disconnected (`!token`), it renders the neutral instruction message (`Connect your Trakt account in Settings or click Connect Trakt above...`) and clears `#myPrivateTraktListsResult`, eliminating mock cards and "Couldn't load previews for this list. Retry" errors.
  - Aligned `disconnectTrakt()` and `renderTraktConnectStatus()` to maintain the neutral prompt on disconnect.
- **Explore Channels Public Publishing**:
  - In `saveChannel()`, when a channel is saved with Public toggle ON, it automatically publishes to the Cloudflare Worker explore directory (`/api/channel/share` with `publish: true`), saves `shareCode` and `sharePublished: true`, and updates the Explore Channels directory.
  - When saved with Public toggle OFF, if the channel was previously published, it unpublishes from the directory via `/api/channel/unpublish`.
- **Channel Share Modal Alignment**:
  - Implemented `showSavedChannelModal(name, visibility, url)` in `20_client-channel-builder.js` matching `showSavedCustomListModal` in Custom Lists:
    - Heading: `✓ Channel Saved`
    - Subtext: `"{name}" has been saved to your Profile as a {public|private} channel.`
    - Copy link section: read-only vanity URL input with an inline `Copy Link` button.
    - Footer buttons: `Open Link ↗` and `Done`.
  - Replaced generic `showAppAlert` in `saveChannel()` and `shareChannelById()`.
- **My Channels Delete Button Styling**:
  - Removed `color:var(--danger);` from the Delete button in `renderMyCreatedChannelsList()` in `20_client-channel-builder.js`, rendering it as a standard secondary (black/dark text) button matching My Lists.
- **Private Channel Edit Toggle Persistence**:
  - Added `visibility` and `owner` to `channelShareFields(src)` and `saveLocalChannel(payload)` so private channel visibility is preserved in local storage and never lost on save.
  - Updated `applyChannelBroadcastSettings()` so editing a private channel keeps `#channelPublicToggle.checked = false`.
- **Channel Builder & Custom List Form Layout**:
  - Removed `Shuffle now` from `#channelPlayOrderSelect` in `13_tab-channels.js` and `#customListPlayOrderSelect` in `12_tab-custom-lists.js`.
  - Added dedicated `Shuffle picks now` button beside `Remove All` in Channel Builder (`13_tab-channels.js`), matching Custom Lists.
  - Moved `#channelVisibilityRow` (the Public toggle switch) to sit directly beneath `Remove All` and `Shuffle picks now`.

- **Public Channel URLs (`/channels/(username)/(name-of-channel)`)**:
  - Replaced `/channel/:code` share URLs with personalized vanity links: `https://mylistsadd.com/channels/(username)/(name-of-channel)` (e.g. `${ORIGIN}/channels/${encodeURIComponent(username)}/${slug}`).
  - Added dedicated `/channels/:username/:slug.json` endpoint to serve the channel payload directly.
  - Retained full backward compatibility for legacy `/channel/:code` links with automatic 302 redirects to `/configure#channel=<code>`.
- **Custom List Edit Page Alignment**:
  - Replaced visibility `<select>` dropdown with the Public/Private `.ui-toggle` switch (`#customListPublicToggle`), matching the New List modal.
  - Replaced legacy "Randomize order (reshuffles once a day)" checkbox with the Play Order dropdown (including "Shuffle daily", "Aired (oldest first)", "Aired (newest first)", and "Title (A-Z)").
  - Added collapsible `<details class="channel-advanced-details">` drawer with Play Order and "Hide watched — skip items already in my watch history" checkbox (`#customListHideWatchedCheck`), omitting channel-only broadcast settings.
- **My Channels Action Buttons & Form Controls**:
  - Pruned action buttons on My Channels cards to strictly `Edit`, `Delete`, `Share` (rendered only if public/published), and `+ Add` / `Remove`.
  - Added Public/Private `.ui-toggle` switch (`#channelPublicToggle`) to the Channel Builder create/edit form.
  - Renamed Hide Watched checkbox label to lowercase: `"Hide watched — skip episodes already in my watch history"`.
  - Removed "Publish one of your own" panel from Explore Channels.
  - Removed "On Today" tab/button (`#detailTypeLineupBtn`) from channel details views.
- **Explore Channels Poster Mosaic**:
  - Upgraded Explore Channels cards to match other list cards with a 9-poster desktop / 3-poster mobile mosaic (`.list-card-posters.poster-preview-static`), sample items payload, and "See all" preview button.
- **Removed Quick Channel Wizard**:
  - Removed the Quick Channel Wizard from Channels Quick Add (`channelsSubQuickAdd`) and the Quick List Wizard from Discover / Catalogs Quick Add (`catalogsSubQuickAdd`).
- **Simkl Disconnected State**:
  - Suppressed red error message (`✗ Please connect your Simkl account first.`) when Simkl account is not connected or `!token`, displaying clean neutral instructions instead.

### 🧩 Frontend Architecture & Code-Reuse Consolidation

- **Unified Drag & Drop Engine (`createSortableList`)**: Replaced 4 divergent drag-and-drop systems across lists, channels, custom list draft picks, and creator profile lists with a shared, idempotent pointer and HTML5 drag engine in `16_client-row-core.js` supporting both 1D lists (`axis: 'y'`) and 2D poster grids (`axis: 'xy'`).
- **Eliminated All Native Browser Dialogs (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`)**: Replaced all 18 client-side native `confirm()` prompts and 6 `prompt()` dialogs with styled, accessible modal dialogs (`showAppConfirm`, `confirmDialog`, `showAppPrompt`, `promptDialog`), and routed native `window.alert()` to non-blocking toast notifications (`showToast`) and accessible alerts (`showAppAlert`), eliminating browser UI thread blocks.
- **Live Preview & Editor Clean Shelf Presentation**: Suppressed `.cw-remove-btn` from Live Preview & Editor shelves (`#lists`), ensuring no configured list or catalog row displays the red circular '✕' button on simulated Stremio shelves.
- **Explore Channels "+ Add" / "Remove" Button Dynamic Toggle**: Enhanced Explore Channels directory cards so clicking `+ Add` dynamically updates the button to `Remove` (and vice-versa when removed), correctly syncing with `#lists` (Live Preview & Editor) without deleting saved channels from local storage or creating orphaned listings.
- **Next Up Channel Poster & Artwork Fallbacks**: Derived poster artwork for dynamic Next Up channels from seeded Continue Watching items or `/api/channel-poster` SVG generation, ensuring published Next Up channels and cards always display artwork.
- **Removed "One line about this channel" Inputs**: Removed redundant description text inputs from the Channel Builder (`13_tab-channels.js`) and the publish list card (`20_client-channel-builder.js`).
- **WCAG 2.2 AA Contrast Compliance for `--muted`**: Updated `--muted` in `09_page-shell.js` to `#636366` in light theme and `#AEAEB2` in dark theme for full WCAG AA 4.5:1 contrast compliance.
- **Watchlist Modal Display Label Normalization**: Normalized `Watchlist (Movies)` and `Watchlist (Shows)` to display consistently as `Watchlist` in the "Add / Remove from Lists" modal whether adding a show or a movie.
- **Toast Theme Alignment**: Redesigned `.app-toast`, `.undo-toast`, and `.action-toast` to adapt cleanly to light and dark themes with no colored left accent border.
- **"Remove All" Capitalization**: Renamed all instances of "Remove all" to "Remove All" across all tab views and builders.
- **Removed "Unsaved Changes" Banner**: Removed `#unsavedInstallBanner` and associated background poll/update button that caused confusion regarding whether saved configurations auto-update in Stremio/Nuvio or require re-installation.
- **Removed Duplicate Provider "+ New List" Buttons**: Retained the single, primary "+ New List" button next to Refresh in the "Your Custom Lists" header of `12_tab-custom-lists.js`, removing 4 competing buttons from individual provider headers.
- **1-Click Stremio & Nuvio Deep Links**: Added dedicated 1-click install action buttons (`stremio://...`, `nuvio://...`, and Stremio Web) to the install results card in `24_client-backup-restore-presets.js`, alongside the manifest copy button for manual configurations.
- **Progressive Disclosure for Channels**: Wrapped play orders, broadcast turnover dials, and smart rules inside a collapsible `<details class="channel-advanced-details">` drawer with the default being manual/created order (`as-listed`), keeping custom channel building fast and uncluttered.
- **Poster Aspect Ratio Standardization**: Enforced strict `aspect-ratio: 2 / 3` with `object-fit: cover` across `.live-preview-poster` and `.media-card-poster` to prevent layout shifts during image loading.
- **Unified Toast Notification System (`showToast`)**: Consolidated multiple disjoint toast systems (`showAddedToast`, `showUndoToast`, and custom banners) into a single queue-managed toast engine with support for action buttons (e.g. Gmail-style "Undo") and dismiss handlers.
- **Standardized Poster & Media Cards (`renderMediaCard`)**: Unified disparate poster card HTML generation across Search, Discover, Channels, and Custom Lists into a single standardized component obeying HTML Living Standard specifications.
- **Shared Input Debounce (`debounce`)**: Added reusable debounce utility with cancellation support for all search and filter bars.

### 📺 Channels: pairing glue, and channels that keep themselves up to date

- **"Keep multi-part episodes together."** Every ordering step a channel has had until now could split a
  two-parter: the daily rotation deals a block that ends between the halves, the shuffle scatters
  them, the interleaver drops four other shows into the gap. The new toggle reads episode titles for
  `Part 1` / `Pt. II` / `(2)` and glues each story back into one run -- whenever any part of it is
  drawn, the whole story plays there, in part order. Drawing Part 2 first plays the story from Part 1
  rather than handing you the back half of it, and a part the channel does not have is simply not
  there while the rest still play together. Same show, same season and the same story name are all
  required, so a remake nine seasons later and another show's episode of the same name are left
  alone, and one story is capped at six episodes so a show whose every episode is "Chapter One" cannot
  glue a season into one block.
- **Pair by hand, for what a title cannot show.** A crossover event runs across two *different* shows
  under two different names, which no title-based rule can see. Select the picks in the builder and
  hit **Pair**: they play back to back wherever the first of them is drawn, toggle or not, because
  you asked for it explicitly. **Unpair** undoes it, a pick can only belong to one pairing, and a
  pairing whose other half is removed from the channel is dropped rather than saved forward -- the
  same rule Story Lock follows.
- **"Automatically add new episodes."** A channel has always been a snapshot: add The Last of Us today
  and the channel still holds exactly those episodes a year later while the show moves on without it.
  With this on, the Worker re-checks each show the channel carries and folds in whatever has aired
  since, **at the top** or at the end as the channel says. It costs a request nothing: the check runs
  on a background task with nobody waiting on it, the answer is cached for twelve hours (an empty
  answer too, so a channel of finished shows stops re-checking), and it is thrown away the moment the
  channel is edited, since an answer about the old picks would re-add an episode the channel now has
  by hand. Only seasons at or past the highest one a channel already carries are asked about, so a
  channel of ten-season shows costs one or two TMDB calls each -- and only episodes that have actually
  aired are added, because a slot playing next month's announcement plays nothing at all.
- Both flags travel with a share link and into the directory, and both appear in the channel's rule
  line next to the ones already there.

### 🩹 Channels: On Today, corrected

- **A rotating channel put one show on the air instead of twenty-four.** The builder writes `0` for
  both broadcast dials whenever the schedule panel is closed, and the engine read that 0 as a real
  number and clamped it up to its floor of 1 — so a Quick Add network channel ran *1 show × 1
  episode* a day. 0 now means "unset" and falls back to the network numbers (24 × 3), which is what
  the channel's own stats line had been claiming all along. The share sanitizer writes the plan it
  resolved back into the payload, so the same 0 was being *baked in* as a real 1 × 1 on every
  channel that travelled through a share link or the directory; those now arrive at 24 × 3 too.
- **There was no way back from On Today.** On a single-type channel the previous fix hid All along
  with Movies and Shows, which left the lineup as a tab with no exit. The pills now read exactly as
  you would expect: **All** and **On Today** on a channel of only shows or only movies, and **All**,
  **Movies**, **Shows** and **On Today** on one with both. Coming back off On Today restores the
  list's own subtitle, recomputed rather than remembered, and a page of items that arrives while
  On Today is open is accumulated quietly instead of being drawn over the lineup.
- **"On today" is now "On Today"**, to match every other pill on the page.

### 🩹 Channels: four fixes

- **My Channels now rearranges the way My Lists does** — a drag handle in the card's title, and
  nothing else. The number box and up/down arrows are gone; the two lists sit one tab apart and
  should not offer two different ways to do the same thing.
- **"Publish one of your own" is drawn the way Explore Channels draws a channel** — artwork, title,
  description and the same meta line. Both are built by one function now, which is what stops a
  description appearing in one place and not the other.
- **Deleting a published channel left it published.** Deleting removed this browser's copy only, so
  the directory kept advertising a channel its owner had deleted — and because the local record was
  the only thing that knew the share code, there was no longer anything to unpublish *with*.
  Deleting now withdraws the listing as it goes, and because that is a network call that can fail,
  the publish panel also lists **listings you still have up with no channel behind them**, each with
  its own Unpublish. (A new `/api/channel/mine` answers that: the browser cannot, since the record
  that knew the code is the one that was deleted.)
- **"On Today" never appeared on a channel of only shows, or only movies.** The tab lived inside the
  branch that draws the Movies/Shows filter, and that branch only ran for a list with *both* kinds
  in it — so a channel qualified by accident. It now appears for any channel saved in this browser,
  and on a single-type channel only the Movies/Shows pills are hidden, since two pills showing the
  same list are two pills with nothing to say.

### 🧰 Channels: a fixed toolbar, and a list you can arrange

- **The search boxes under My Channels and Explore Channels had collapsed.** Both inputs and the
  `<select>` beside them inherit `width: 100%`, so in a flex row the select took the whole width and
  squeezed the input down to nothing. They now follow the same pattern the Live Preview toolbar has
  always used — the input grows, the select is pinned to its own content with `flex: none;
  width: auto` — and the filter box in the Channel builder is pinned the same way rather than
  relying on a button's default width.
- **My Channels can be rearranged**, with the three controls a catalog row has had all along: a drag
  handle (mouse *and* touch), up/down buttons, and a position you can type. A new **My order** entry
  joins the sort dropdown, and rearranging switches to it automatically so the list does not
  re-sort out from under the card you just moved. Rearranging while another ordering is on screen
  adopts *that* as the starting arrangement, so a card lands where it looked like it would.
- **Rearranging while filtered leaves hidden channels alone.** A move permutes the visible channels
  among the slots they already occupy and never rebuilds the whole order from a partial view — the
  same rule the channel draft's own filtered drag follows.

### 🛠️ Channels: nine things that make one easier to build, find and moderate

**Editing a big channel**

- **Bulk select.** A channel with 800 picks was drag-one-at-a-time, type-a-position, or Remove all.
  **Select** turns the draft into checkboxes: tap anywhere on a card, pick out a whole show or one
  season from a menu, then **Remove selected**, **To top** or **To bottom**. Selection is by index
  and every move rebuilds it, because an index that survives a reorder is an index pointing at the
  wrong pick.
- **A filter over the draft**, matching show, episode title and the S/E people actually type
  (`s5e12`). Bulk actions only ever act on what is on screen, so a filter cannot quietly reach a
  pick you cannot see.
- **A duplicate warning.** Adding a show from two different places, or splicing the same crossover
  in twice, used to just work — and you found out later, by which point the duplicate is somewhere
  in eight hundred rows.

**Knowing what you built**

- **Runtimes are stored** on each pick (from TMDB, where it has them), which is what the hours
  count below is made of — and the groundwork for anything schedule-shaped later.
- **A stats line**, under the draft and on each channel's card: `12 shows · 800 episodes ·
  ~412 hours · 1989–2004 · 24 shows × 3 a day · 3 story-locked · hides watched`. The hours are
  marked with a `~` whenever some picks predate runtimes being stored, rather than being quietly
  wrong.
- **"On Today"**, a new tab beside Movies and Shows on a channel's See All page: the lineup the
  Worker would serve *right now*, numbered in playing order. You could set 24 shows × 3 episodes
  and, until now, only find out what that produced by opening the channel in Stremio. The Worker
  answers it through the same function the meta route uses — a second copy of the seeded shuffle on
  the page is the kind of thing that drifts by one episode and is never noticed.

**Finding and keeping channels**

- **A description on the channel itself.** It used to live only on the directory listing, so
  unpublishing a channel deleted the sentence describing it and a channel shared by link had
  nowhere to carry one. Publishing now uses the channel's own line when none is typed.
- **My Channels sorts and searches** — by recently updated, created, name or size, and findable by
  name, description, or a show inside it, which is usually how people remember one. **Deleting a
  channel can be undone** for a minute afterwards, which every catalog row could already do and the
  one action that can discard 800 hand-picked episodes could not.
- **Explore Channels has likes and ordering**: newest, most added, most liked, or by name. "Most
  added" ranks by how many people actually took a channel, which is a better signal than a vote
  because taking one costs something. Likes use the same one-identity-one-vote ledger lists use,
  and the count is always derived from that ledger rather than incremented, so it cannot drift
  upward on its own. Editing and re-publishing a channel keeps its votes.

**Moderation**

- **An operator can now moderate the channel directory.** Publishing was owner-only with no
  operator path at all: if someone published something abusive, the only person who could take it
  down was the person who put it there — worse than the standard published *lists* have held since
  they existed. The admin dashboard now lists the directory (and, separately, every stored channel,
  including ones quietly unlisted or orphaned by a lost index write), with two distinct actions:
  **Unlist** removes the directory listing and leaves existing share links working, and **Delete**
  removes the stored channel so every link to it stops working, taking its like ledger with it.

### 🔧 Channels: fixes from the first round of use

- **A Spotlight channel took episodes its subject is not in.** Tobey Maguire's single guest
  appearance in Roseanne put *ten* Roseanne episodes into the channel, because a TV credit meant
  "take this show's first N episodes". It now asks which episodes are actually his: a season's own
  `credits.cast` is that season's regulars (who are in every episode of it without being listed on
  each one), and each episode's `guest_stars` and `crew` name everyone else — so a regular
  contributes the whole season and a one-episode guest contributes one episode. Directing credits
  count too, so a director's spotlight is the episodes they *made*.
- **"Add everything" now means everything** — every film, and every episode of every show, with no
  per-show slice and no four-show cap.
- **The whole lot is ordered together.** Films first and television after read as broken: a 1993
  guest spot played *after* a 2022 film in what was supposed to be career order. Films and episodes
  are now sorted as one set, so each episode sits where it belongs among the films. Best-first ranks
  an episode by its show's rating, which keeps a show's run together.
- **Per-show precision.** In a filmography, a show's button adds only that person's episodes; its
  poster still opens the full season-and-episode picker.
- **Re-sharing a channel you published was refused as someone else's.** An unlisted re-share proved
  nothing about who was sending it, so the ownership check on the record it was overwriting turned
  down the record's own owner. Credentials now go with a re-share as well as a publish.
- **The share link was unreachable once the modal closed.** A channel that has been shared now
  carries **Copy link** on its card, and a published one shows its link in the Explore Channels
  publish panel. **Share** became **Update link** for a channel that already has one, which is what
  it does.
- **Dialogs no longer scroll sideways.** A share URL has no spaces to break at, so it widened the
  modal past the screen. Long words now wrap.
- **Explore Channels cards open.** Tapping one — or **See all** — shows every show, film and
  episode in that channel before you decide to add it. Looking at a channel no longer files it
  under My Channels.
- **The generated channel poster showed no text in Nuvio** while Stremio drew it correctly. The SVG
  named `-apple-system`/`BlinkMacSystemFont` and a quoted `'Segoe UI'`, used numeric font weights,
  and wrapped the channel name in an `feDropShadow` filter — a rasterizer that resolves none of
  those fonts, or drops a filtered subtree it cannot render, loses the text while drawing everything
  else. It is now `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`, `font-weight="bold"`, explicit `x`/`y` on every
  `<text>`, and the name's shadow is a second offset copy rather than a filter.

### 📺 Channels: broadcast scheduling, smart rules, sharing and a directory

Ten additions, all of them in the Channels tab. The three that change how an existing channel
*could* play are opt-in and off by default, so every channel saved before this plays exactly as
it did.

**Play order and scheduling**

- **Interleaved (round-robin) play order.** A new entry in the **Play order** dropdown deals one
  episode from each show in turn, then rounds again —
  `Simpsons S1E1 ➔ King of the Hill S1E1 ➔ Malcolm S1E1 ➔ Simpsons S1E2`. That is what a 90s
  prime-time block actually felt like, and the opposite of playing fifty episodes of one show
  before the next one starts. Like the other sorts it is re-applied as picks are added, and it is
  idempotent, so the builder and the Worker cannot fight over it.
- **Daily Broadcast Schedule, for any channel.** Quick Add's network channels have always rotated
  24 shows × 3 episodes out of a much bigger pool; that is now a panel under the play-order
  dropdown for any channel you build, with three dials: **shows per day**, **episodes per block**,
  and the **time of day the lineup turns over** (UTC or your own local time, rather than always
  midnight UTC — which is the previous evening everywhere west of Greenwich). Load a 1,000-episode
  pool of sitcoms and it reads like a cable channel with fresh programming every morning.
- **Story Lock.** Shuffling suits a procedural — Seinfeld, The Office, Law & Order — and ruins a
  serialized one. Tick a show as story-locked and it always advances to its next episode in order,
  picking up the next day where the last block left off, while every other show keeps shuffling
  around it. The positions it occupies still move, so it stays spread through the day rather than
  stuck in one block.
- **Hide watched.** With Auto-track playback on, a channel can suppress episodes already in your
  Watch History. Applied *before* the daily rotation, so an episode you have seen costs the channel
  nothing rather than a slot in today's lineup — and once the whole pool has been seen the channel
  comes back rather than going dark.

**Channels that build themselves**

- **Next Up channel.** One button under My Channels. The lineup is re-derived from your Continue
  Watching on the server on every request, so pressing play always serves the next unwatched
  episode across everything you have on the go, and the channel follows what you are actually
  watching instead of freezing the day it was made. It is also **seeded** from this browser's own
  Continue Watching when you create it: the Worker can only re-derive a lineup for an install
  config that has proved which account it speaks for, and a config with no personal shelf in it
  never does — so without a seed the channel came back *empty* for exactly the people most likely
  to try it first. The seed is what it plays until the live answer arrives, and what it falls back
  to if that proof is ever missing. **Refresh** on the channel's card pulls in whatever you have
  started watching since.
- **Quick Channel Wizard.** Three dropdowns in Quick Add — network or studio, era, genre or mood —
  and a finished 24/7 channel compiled from the top shows that match. No blank canvas to fill in.
- **Spotlight channels.** **Actors & Directors** joins Shows and Movies as a search type in the
  builder. Tapping a result opens their whole filmography *below the search*, exactly the way
  tapping a show opens its seasons — films and television listed separately, each film addable on
  its own, and each show opening into the same season-and-episode picker you get from the Shows
  tab. **Add everything as a Spotlight channel** is still one click for when the whole filmography
  is the point. Sorted chronologically (a career unfolding) or best-first, and the order comes from
  the server so changing it re-asks rather than re-sorting one page — which credits make the cut is
  decided by popularity, and only their order is the sort. Directing and creating credits count,
  not only acting ones, so a Nolan or a Miyazaki spotlight is the films they *made*.
- **Live Cloud Sync.** Importing a Trakt/MDBList/Simkl/TMDB list used to take a one-time snapshot,
  frozen for good. A channel can now keep the source URL instead: the Worker rebuilds its pool from
  that list in the background, so a public list gaining a title gains it here too. The rebuild never
  sits on the request's critical path — a request serves the stored pool and schedules the refresh.

**Sharing**

- **One-click share links.** **Share** on any channel copies a link that rebuilds it anywhere —
  every pick, its play order and its broadcast schedule. A channel is thousands of episodes and a
  link is a few hundred characters, so the link carries a short code and the channel is stored
  behind it; opening the link hands the code over in the URL *fragment*, which never reaches a
  server log. Re-sharing an edited channel updates the link people already have rather than minting
  a second one beside it.
- **Explore Channels.** A new tab listing channels other people have published — add one to your own
  setup in a single click, then edit it however you like. Publishing needs a Creator Profile so
  every listing has an owner who can take it down again; **Unpublish** removes the listing and
  leaves links already handed out working. Sharing privately needs no account at all.

Everything arriving from someone else's channel is rebuilt field by field before it is stored or
rendered: art that is not an `http(s)` URL is dropped, a Story Lock for a show the shared picks do
not contain is dropped, and Live Cloud Sync travels only with a real list URL behind it.

### 🐛 Fixed: air times did not appear, and a channel pick could show yesterday's date

- **Air times were missing on shows you had recently opened.** The details cache is keyed by id, type and
  region only — nothing about the shape of what it stores — so after the air-time deploy it kept handing
  back copies written *before* it, with no air time in them, for up to two hours. The key now carries a
  payload-shape version that a field change moves, which retires every stale copy at once.
- **A movie in a Channel could show the previous day's date** — a 1996 film reading `Dec 31, 1995`. The
  date was pinned to midnight UTC, which is the previous evening everywhere west of Greenwich. It is now
  11:00 UTC, which holds the intended date from UTC-11 to UTC+12:45. (World offsets span 26 hours, so no
  single instant is right in all of them; this one is wrong only at UTC+13/+14.)

### 🎬 Known limit, documented: a movie in a Channel may have no streams in strict add-ons

- **What happens**: a movie added to a Channel plays in Nuvio and in lenient add-ons (Torrentio-style), and
  shows no streams in strict ones (PenguPlay). A Channel's metadata is a *series*, and Stremio does not
  work out a type per video — so tapping a movie asks every stream add-on for
  `/stream/series/<the movie's own IMDb id>.json`, and add-ons that branch on that `type` before reading
  the id answer with nothing.
- **This cannot be fixed from inside the add-on.** The type comes from the parent metadata, and no id shape
  gets around it: `tt123:1:1` points at a season 1 episode 1 that does not exist, and a bare number or a
  private prefix matches no `idPrefixes` anywhere, so no add-on is even asked.
- **Tried and removed**: answering that request with a link to the movie's own page. Stremio Web treats an
  external link as *leaving* Stremio — it routes through a `stremio.com/warning` interstitial and then
  hands the `stremio://` scheme to the operating system — so it was a dead end that looked like a working
  option. It is gone rather than left in place looking useful.
- **What works today**: open the movie from its own page, or use a client that resolves the id itself.
  The two ways to fix this properly each cost something real — proxying your own stream add-on (which means
  this add-on holding your debrid key) or splitting a Channel's movies into a separate movie row (which
  takes them out of the Channel's play order) — so neither is done on the add-on's own initiative.

### 🕒 Episode air times: `9 PM ET` under the air date

- **An episode airing today or later now shows the hour it is on**, under the date on its own page and
  under the day on its Continue Watching / Airing Next badge — `9 PM ET`, `9:30 PM ET`. An episode that
  has already gone out shows no time: it is a thing you are waiting for.
- **TMDB has no episode air time at all** — it dates an episode and stops, which is why every "Airs
  Tuesday" in this add-on has been a day with no hour behind it. The time comes from
  [TVmaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) instead, which needs **no API key**, so a self-hosted Worker gets
  this with nothing to configure and nothing to pay for.
- **The show's regular slot, plus the next episode's own** where TVmaze dates it apart from it — a
  premiere running long, a finale moved an hour. Every other upcoming episode gets the regular slot, which
  is what a listing prints for them anyway.
- **Only a show with an episode still to come is ever looked up**, and the answer is cached for twelve
  hours (a week in KV): a broadcast slot is a fact about a season, not about a day. A finished show costs
  nothing, because nothing displays a time against an episode that has already aired.
- **North American slots are named the way a schedule is spoken** — `ET`, `CT`, `MT`, `PT` — rather
  than `EDT`/`EST`, which flip twice a year and read as though the time moved. Elsewhere the zone's own
  short name is used.
- **Nothing is invented.** A streaming show with no broadcast slot, a show TVmaze has never heard of, or
  TVmaze being down all come out the same way: the date on its own, exactly as before. An air time is
  never worth failing a details lookup over.
- **Stremio rows say it too**: an Airing Next row's description now reads
  `Next Episode: S03E06 · Airs 2026-10-04 at 9:30 PM ET`.

### ✅ A show's page says how much of each season you have watched, and "watched" means what has aired

- **Every season header now reads `3/8 episodes`** instead of `8 episodes` — how many of that season are in
  your Watch History, beside how many there are. `0/8` for a season you have not started, `8/8` in the accent
  colour once it is finished.
- **It moves as you do.** Marking an episode from the grid, a season from its button, or the whole show
  updates every count on the page, without reopening it.
- **A show you are caught up on mid-season now reads as watched.** The Mark Show Watched button says **Mark
  Show Unwatched** once every episode that has *aired* has been watched, rather than waiting for a season
  finale that has not gone out yet. Same for the season button beside it.
- **Why it was wrong**: "fully watched" was counted against TMDB's `episode_count`, which includes the
  episodes still to come. Watching 5 of a 10-episode season with episode 6 a month away came out as 5/10 —
  unwatched — so the button offered to mark episodes already seen. The exact episode list settles it, but
  it was only loaded after a season was expanded or the show was marked watched wholesale.
- **No extra requests**: `/api/details` already carries the show's next unaired episode
  (`nextEpisodeSeasonNumber` / `nextEpisodeNumber` / `nextEpisodeAirDate`), which places every season around
  it — a later season has aired nothing, the season it falls in has aired everything before that episode,
  an earlier one is out in full. An episode list, once loaded, still wins over it.
- **Marking the last aired episode watched now flips the show's button** where it used to sit on "Mark Show
  Watched" until the page was reopened, and it repaints every season's button rather than only the one last
  expanded.
- **A show rebuilt from an episode group keeps its old behaviour.** An anime unpacked into its own seasons is
  not numbered the way TMDB numbers it, so the show-level pointer is not applied to it.
- **Fixed: one show's episode lists answering for another's.** The season and episode caches were keyed by
  season and episode number, never cleared between shows, so the last show's season 1 decided what had aired
  in this one's. They are cleared when a show's page opens, and on sign-out.

### 🔀 A Channel's Play order is a menu of arrangements, and a pick you move stays moved

- **Replaces the two checkboxes** added below with one **Play order** dropdown in the Channel builder:
  *As listed (custom)*, *Air date — oldest first*, *Air date — newest first*, *Show, then season &
  episode*, *Title A–Z*, *Shuffle now*, *Shuffle daily*. "Shuffle picks now" moves into it as an entry
  rather than a separate button.
- **A sort now rearranges the picks themselves**, right there in the list, instead of being a rule the
  Worker re-applied on every request. So the order on screen is the order that plays — and **moving a pick
  by hand simply stays**, which the "Sort by air date" checkbox could not do: it silently overrode every
  manual move except between two picks sharing a date.
- **A sort stays selected and is re-applied when picks are added**, so an air-date channel lands each new
  episode in its place instead of at the bottom as the channel grows. It hooks `renderChannelDraftList`,
  the one call every add path already ends with, so every way of adding picks is covered.
- **Moving a pick by hand switches the dropdown back to *As listed*** and stops the re-sorting there: from
  that point the order is the person's. Dragging and typing a position both disarm it before they re-render.
- **"Shuffle daily" is the only entry that stays a mode**, because it is the only one no stored order can
  express — the Worker reshuffles it from a date-based seed each day. The list order is ignored while it is
  selected, and the hint under the dropdown says so.
- **Air date and release date are one field, not two.** A saved pick keeps a single date: TMDB's `air_date`
  for an episode, the release date for a movie. Both air-date sorts read it, and anything undated sorts
  last in either direction — "newest first" is still no reason to open a channel with picks that could not
  be placed at all.
- **Channels already set to "Sort by air date" keep playing correctly.** The Worker still honours that flag
  for a channel nobody has edited; opening one in the builder sorts its picks for real, selects the
  matching entry, and saving drops the flag.
- **A Quick Add network channel is no longer re-ordered at serve time by a sort**, which also settles the
  odd case where air-date order interleaved a rotating channel's day across shows: the rotation decides the
  day's lineup, and the stored order is whatever the builder arranged.

### 🗓️ A Channel can play in air date order

- **Asked for**: a way to sort a channel by aired date when creating or editing it, working like *Randomize
  play order* but with only one of the two selectable.
- **New checkbox in the Channel builder: *Sort by air date*.** The channel plays oldest first across every
  show in it -- so a channel of Friends, Seinfeld and Frasier runs as the week they actually went out,
  rather than one show at a time.
- **Nothing is looked up for it.** Every pick already stores the date TMDB gave when it was added:
  `/api/show-episodes` returns each episode's own `air_date` (a movie carries its release date, or the year
  the builder had), the builder saves it as `released` on the item, and the ordering is decided from the
  saved payload alone -- no extra request, on the page or in the Worker.
- **It and *Randomize play order* are one choice.** Ticking either clears the other on the page, and
  `saveChannel` drops the other flag on the way out, so no channel is ever saved as both. A payload old
  enough to carry both (shuffle was the only flag that existed) resolves the same way in the Worker: the
  explicit sort wins.
- **Leaving both off is still a real answer** -- the picks play in the order they are listed, which is why
  these are two checkboxes and not a radio group.
- **A dateless pick plays last**, keeping its saved order, rather than opening the channel; two episodes
  aired the same night keep the order they were added in, which is what puts a two-part premiere back in
  broadcast order.
- **A Quick Add network channel can use it too**: the daily rotation still picks *which* shows and episodes
  play today, and the sort then decides the order they play in.
- **"See All" agrees with it.** The channel details page reads the saved items directly rather than through
  the Worker, so it now applies the same ordering -- it was listing air-date channels in whatever order
  their picks happened to be stored in.

### 📺 A Channel episode asks a stream add-on for the episode it actually is

- **Reported**: "Non-debrid addons (like Pengu) dont pickup the fake episodes order. I.e: FRIENDS randomized
  channel has the S01E01 at the start of the queue when in fact it's, let's say, S05E13. With Debrid addons
  it plays correctly the S05E13, but non debrid scrapes the original S01E01."
- **A Channel video's `id` *is* its stream request.** Stremio asks every installed stream add-on for
  `/stream/<type>/<video.id>.json` and sends nothing else -- the `season`/`episode` on each video are the
  channel's own running order, for display, and never reach an add-on at all. So a malformed id is not a
  dead link anybody notices: something plays, it is just the wrong thing.
- **`parseInt(it.season, 10) || 1` could not tell "no season" from season 0.** Both became 1, so an item
  stored without a season or an episode was published as `<show>:1:1` -- that show's series premiere, under
  the title of the episode we meant. Such an item is now dropped from the channel instead: a missing episode
  is something a person can report, a wrong one looks like it worked.
- **A show with no IMDb id was published as a bare TMDB number.** `12345:5:13` matches no `idPrefixes`
  anywhere, so no add-on is ever asked for it. It is now the `tmdb:12345:5:13` form this add-on's own
  manifest declares and the rest of the app already reads. An id that is neither `tt...` nor `tmdb:...`
  (including the empty string, which used to publish as `:5:13`) is dropped.
- **The Channel builder stores the same shapes.** `channelStreamShowId` is applied where draft items are
  built -- picked episodes, "Add every season", Quick Add Channel and the crossover/storyline channels --
  so the Worker's check has nothing left to catch. The episode picker now carries the show's TMDB id
  alongside its IMDb id, which is what gives an IMDb-less show a real fallback rather than an empty one.
- **The shuffled running order is untouched**, and a dropped item closes its gap rather than leaving a hole:
  the queue is still 1..N. For a channel whose items all carry a real `tt` id and a real season and episode
  -- which a Friends channel built from TMDB does -- the published id was already correct, and a stream
  add-on that returns S01E01 for `tt0108778:5:13` is resolving it wrongly on its own side.

### ⏭️ Nothing marks a future episode as watched any more

- **Reported**: "if i use the Mark Show Watched the future season is marked as watched but the episode isnt
  marked as watched and the show isnt added to continue watching."
- **What was happening**: `markShowWatched` has always fetched only *aired* episodes -- so nothing wrong
  went into Watch History -- but it finished by relabelling **every** `.btn-mark-season-watched` on screen
  to "Mark Season Unwatched", including a season that has not started. The button claimed a season was
  watched over an empty Watch History. It now relabels only the seasons it actually wrote to (the aired
  episodes it fetched say which), and hands the rest to the shared state below.
- **One description of that button, instead of four.** The item modal's first render,
  `updateSeasonWatchedButton`, `markSeasonWatched`'s own result and `markShowWatched`'s bulk relabel each
  set it their own way and disagreed about the not-yet-aired case. `seasonWatchedButtonState` is now the
  single answer, and an upcoming season gets a disabled button saying when it airs rather than one that
  looks pressable and does nothing.
- **"Fully watched" now means caught up.** `isShowFullyWatched` required *every* regular season to be fully
  watched, so one announced season made it false forever: reopening the modal contradicted the button the
  person had just pressed. Seasons with nothing aired are excluded, matching what Mark Show Watched
  actually marks.
- **A caught-up show stays in Continue Watching.** Marking the last aired episode one at a time leaves the
  show on the shelf with an "Airs …" badge for what is coming; Mark Show Watched was the one path that
  evicted it outright. It now keeps the upcoming entry the reconciliation just computed, and only evicts
  (and queues a storyline conclusion like Breaking Bad → El Camino) when there is genuinely nothing left
  to air.
- **The episode modal no longer offers a watch button on an unaired episode** — it shows when the episode
  airs instead — and `toggleWatchStatus`, the single door every episode toggle goes through, refuses to
  *add* one. Removing stays possible, so an entry made before this (or a stray scrobble) can still be
  undone. Marking a show or season with nothing aired yet now says so instead of appearing to fail.
- **Two supporting fixes**: the fetched episode list for a season is now stashed in `_seasonEpisodesMap` by
  `markShowWatched` and `markSeasonWatched` as well as by expanding the grid, so "is this season fully
  watched" stops guessing from `episode_count` (which counts unaired episodes); and `.lc-btn:disabled` now
  actually looks disabled, having been visually identical to a working button.

### 📺 Airing Next: take one show off the shelf without unwatching anything

- **What was missing**: Airing Next lists the next upcoming episode of every show with at least one watched
  episode, and there was no way to say "not this one". The only ways to get a show off it were to remove its
  Watch History entries or to mark the whole show unwatched -- both of which throw away the very record the
  person wanted to keep, and both of which change what is watched everywhere else in the app.
- **The "x" on an Airing Next poster** (dashboard card and the full-page view) now removes just that show
  from just that shelf. Watch History is untouched, every watched badge stays, and Continue Watching is not
  involved at all.
- **Watching another episode brings it back.** The removal is stored as the watched episode it was made at
  -- the same shape `dismissContinueWatchingShow` has always used for Continue Watching -- not as a
  permanent flag. Watching a later episode supersedes it and the show returns on its own, which is what
  makes this a "stop reminding me" rather than a "never show me again". Rewatching an older episode does
  not: nothing about what airs next has changed. The record is dropped once it is superseded, so the stored
  set stays the size of what is actually removed.
- **Applied in one place**: `collectAiringNextCandidateShowIds`, which every rebuild starts from -- the
  6-hourly TMDB refresh, the immediate watch-state sync, the dashboard card's own eligibility check, and the
  list pushed to the `autotrack:airing-next:series:<username>` Stremio catalog. A removal that only reached
  the renderer would have lasted until the next refresh and no longer.
- **Carried on the account, not just the browser.** The shelf is recomputed from Watch History by every
  device that loads the page, so a removal that lived only where it was made would be undone by the next
  device to rebuild and push. It now travels with the tracking record: new columns `airing_removed_season`
  and `airing_removed_episode` on `creator_show_states` (**migration 0012**, listed in the schema manifest
  the `/admin` panel reports on). The Worker checks for the columns before writing them and falls back to
  the pre-0012 statement when they are absent, so a deployment that has not run the migration keeps syncing
  everything else -- it just cannot remember removals. A push that does not mention removals at all (an
  older browser) is treated as having no opinion rather than as saying there are none, so an ordinary
  autosave cannot clear them.
- **A way back by hand**: a "Removed from Airing Next" panel in Settings -> Account & Sync lists what has
  been removed and puts one back, for the show that was removed by mistake and is not currently being
  watched. Hidden entirely when nothing is removed.
- **Found on the way**: `compactCustomListItem` -- which every local list save runs every item through --
  dropped `canonicalTmdbId`, the resolved TMDB id an Airing Next entry is deduped and badge-matched by. The
  field therefore existed only between the shelf being computed and the map being saved, so the dedupe in
  `refreshAiringNext` and the Continue Watching badge match in `buildLocalListCardHtml` were both reading
  something that was never there on a reload. It is kept now, which is also what lets a removal cover both
  ids a show can be recorded under.

### ⏳ "Reset Account Data" looked like nothing was happening

- **What was wrong**: the reset clears this browser first and only then waits on the server -- deliberately,
  so no autosave or scrobble can push the old lists back into the account being emptied. The cost is a
  second or two in which the confirm dialog has already closed, every list on screen has already vanished,
  and nothing says why. That is indistinguishable from a reset that failed, and pressing Reset again is the
  obvious thing to try.
- **A working dialog now covers the gap**, put up before the local clear rather than after the request, and
  replaced by the success or failure dialog when the round trip finishes. New `showAppBusy` next to
  `showAppAlert`/`showAppConfirm`, so the next slow action has one to use.
- **The spinner now spins.** Two places asked for `animation: spin` and the page declared no `@keyframes
  spin` at all, so both -- the new dialog and "Generating install link..." -- sat perfectly still. A test
  now fails on any animation used by name and never declared.

### 🔁 New on Streaming: read whole catalogues, and notice when a title leaves

Two defects in the sweep shipped in the entry below, both found by running it and asking it questions.

- **A fixed page horizon meant the feature could not do the thing it was built for.** The walk was capped at
  `NEW_ON_STREAMING_WALK_DEPTH_PAGES = 40` -- and sorted by release date descending, 40 pages is the ~800
  most recently *released* titles, one to three years. A 2010 film added to Netflix today sits far outside
  that window, so the sweep never fetched the page it was on and the title never entered `streaming_events`
  at all: not as an arrival, not even as a seeded row. The list could only report new *releases* arriving,
  which is the case that needed it least, and is exactly the failure the README cites to justify the feature.
  Depth is now **learned** from the `total_pages` every discover response already carries, so each catalogue
  is read to its end; the only bound left is TMDB's own page-500 pagination limit. A pass grew from 640 pages
  to ~1,000-1,500 (measured, and reported in the admin panel), and `NEW_ON_STREAMING_PAGES_PER_TICK` went
  12 -> 40 to keep a full pass near three hours.
- **Nothing ever marked a title as gone.** `removed_at` existed, the catalog query filtered on it, and the
  upsert cleared it -- but no code path ever *set* it. `last_seen_walk` was written on every sweep and read
  by nothing. So the shelf only ever accumulated: a film that left Netflix in March was still listed in
  December. A completed pass now marks what it did not see, which is only sound because the walk above reads
  whole catalogues.
- **Three guards on that inference**, because a false removal costs a title vanishing and then returning as
  an arrival that never happened: a row must be missed by `NEW_ON_STREAMING_REMOVAL_GRACE_WALKS` (2)
  consecutive passes; a pass that could not read more than `NEW_ON_STREAMING_MAX_PASS_ERRORS` (20) pages
  concludes nothing; and a catalogue that appears to have lost more than `NEW_ON_STREAMING_MAX_REMOVAL_SHARE`
  (25%) of its titles at once is left alone and logged. That last guard is **per catalogue, not per table**,
  and the distinction is the whole point: TMDB answering 200 with an empty result set for one provider is not
  an error, and one service is an eighth of the table, so a table-wide threshold would wave "every Netflix
  title left overnight" through as an ordinary 12%.
- **A title that comes back is dated as a new arrival.** It is on the service today and was not yesterday,
  which is what this shelf reports. Rows are marked, never deleted, precisely so the row is still there to
  clear -- and a title that never left keeps every date it had.
- **Cursor layout 3.** A fixed-depth walk let the cursor be an index into a fixed-length list; a learned-depth
  one cannot, so the cursor is now a coordinate (`page` + `idx` over a stable provider x kind axis) plus the
  pass's accumulated error count. A stored position from an older layout restarts the pass, keeping the walk
  generation -- a database part-way through seeding is still seeding, and promoting it would date every title
  it has not yet reached as an arrival that never happened.
- **Admin panel** reports measured pass size, how many catalogues have been measured, pages per catalogue,
  titles marked gone, this pass's error count, and why a removal was held back.
- **Tests**: the sweep is now driven end-to-end against a stubbed TMDB, so the parts that only happen over
  time are exercised rather than reasoned about -- a catalogue deeper than any fixed horizon collected in
  full, a 2010 title added today picked up and dated as observed, a departure marked only after the grace
  passes, an unreadable pass marking nothing, one provider going dark neither wiping itself nor blocking a
  real departure on a healthy service, a returning title re-dated, and a still-present title keeping its
  original arrival date across passes.

### 🔧 Watch History, Continue Watching and Airing Next read "No items found." in Live Preview & Editor

- **What was wrong**: those three rows are `autotrack:<slug>:<type>:<username>` sources, and reading one
  server-side means reading that account's private tracking record. `/api/preview` is unauthenticated, so
  the username inside that string is a claim until the caller proves it with a Creator Key the endpoint can
  verify — and `mayReadTrackedShelf` answers an unproven reader with an **empty shelf** rather than an error,
  because a catalog row has no way to show a message. Live Preview & Editor and the per-row **Test** button
  both sent `creatorName` with no `creatorKey`, so every one of those shelves came back `ok:true` with
  nothing in it and rendered "No items found." — for its own owner, while the same shelves showed their
  items everywhere else on the page. Airing Next has no share flag at all (only `watchlist`,
  `watch-history` and `continue-watching` do), so proving ownership is the **only** way to read it and it
  could never preview under any setting.
- **Where it came from**: SEC-001's remediation notes "`/api/preview` call sites send the signed-in
  account's key". Two of them did not. `previewCreatorKey` (`23_client-list-management.js`) is now the one
  place that decides, and both call sites use it.
- **The key still travels only where it is needed**: it is attached for a url that actually names a personal
  shelf and nothing else — the same rule `collectKeys` already applies to `trackCreatorKey`, because a
  Creator Key is a bearer credential and a preview of a public mdblist/trakt/tmdb list has no use for one.
  A merged row stacks its sources one per line, so any line naming a personal shelf arms it, not just the
  first. Signed out, nothing is claimed.
- **Tests**: `tests/client.test.mjs` drives `renderLivePreview` against the real bundle — the key is sent for
  Continue Watching, Watch History and Airing Next rows and for a merged row whose personal source is not
  first, and is absent from a public list preview and from a signed-out browser.

### ✨ New on Streaming — a catalog of what actually arrived on a streaming service

A new catalog source, `tmdb:new-on-streaming[:service1+service2]`, sorted by arrival: most recently
added first, with a show pushed back to the top the day a new episode airs. It **ships dark** —
`NEW_ON_STREAMING_IN_QUICK_ADD` (`00_constants.js`) is `false`, so there is no Quick Add card, no
Discover entry and no `/lists/<slug>` page — while the catalog itself is live and installable, which is
the point: it can be judged against real swept data before anyone else can add it.

- **Why it needed building rather than querying**: nothing upstream publishes the date a title landed on
  a service. TMDB's `with_watch_providers` answers "is this on Netflix right now" and says nothing about
  yesterday; Trakt and Simkl do not model provider catalogs at all. The existing `tmdb:genre:stream-releases`
  row sorts by *release* date instead, which is why it shows theatrical-era titles and completely misses an
  old film being added to a service this morning. So the add-on observes arrivals on the cron tick and owns
  the dates: `streaming_events` (`migrations/0011_add_streaming_events.sql`) records the first sighting of a
  title on a service, and that is what the shelf sorts on.
- **The sweep** (`sweepNewOnStreaming`, `07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`) walks a slice of each provider
  catalog per tick from a rotating cursor — 8 providers x 2 kinds x 40 pages, 12 units a tick, about five
  hours for a full pass. Sorted by **release date, not popularity**: a popularity-sorted walk reorders itself
  between the ticks that read its pages, so titles slide across page boundaries and arrivals are both missed
  and invented. A page only costs its own fetch in steady state — the sweep asks D1 which of its TMDB ids it
  already holds and resolves IMDb ids for the rest, and a title arriving on a second service costs no TMDB
  call at all because the first service's row already carries the id.
- **The episode half** (`bumpNewOnStreamingEpisodes`) scans two providers a tick for shows with an episode in
  the last 10 days, keeps only the ones already on the shelf, reads `last_episode_to_air` for the exact date,
  and re-bumps every service's row for that show — a new episode is new wherever you watch it.
- **The first pass is seeded, and says so.** Every title is "new" the first time you look at a catalog, so
  walk 0 dates each title by its own release date rather than pretending it just arrived; walk 1 onward
  records real arrivals. The admin dashboard reports the split as **seeded** versus **observed**, which is
  the one number that says whether the list is working yet.
- **Serving it makes no outbound request at all.** Title, poster, backdrop and year are denormalised into the
  row, so a catalog page is one indexed D1 read — the only shelf here a provider outage cannot slow down or
  empty. Covered by a test that fails if a single `fetch` is issued while rendering it.
- **Admin dashboard**: **Management & Tools → New on Streaming** shows sweep state (cursor, walk generation,
  rows per service, seeded vs observed), runs a sweep on demand, and previews the catalog *through
  `fetchNewOnStreaming` itself* rather than re-deriving the shelf — a second implementation would be the one
  thing guaranteed to disagree with what Stremio gets. Routes: `GET /admin/api/new-on-streaming`,
  `POST /admin/api/new-on-streaming/sweep`, `GET /admin/api/new-on-streaming/preview`.
- **Budget, and the regression it nearly caused**: the sweep is paid for out of the episode sweep's own
  unreachable reserve, not the pre-warm's share. `episodeBudget` is half the tick (5,000 at the default)
  while `CRON_EPISODE_CHECK_MAX` caps actual spend at 300, so 4,700 fetches are reserved by something that
  will never ask for them. Taking a quarter of *that* leaves `cronBudget - episodeBudget` intact — which
  matters, because taking it from the pre-warm dropped it from 40 charts a tick to 35 and quietly broke its
  "the whole list fits in one tick" guarantee. On a free Worker the share comes out at 0 and the sweep skips
  itself with one log line, exactly as chart pre-warming does.
- **Requires D1.** Unlike everything else in this add-on there is no KV fallback: these dates are observed
  over time and cannot be refetched, so a tick that runs without the table is history not collected rather
  than a cache miss. `D1_SCHEMA_MANIFEST` says so, so the schema check reports it.
- **Tests**: `tests/new-on-streaming.test.mjs` — the walk query's ordering and filters, date parsing and
  future-date clamping, selection parsing (including an unknown service degrading to "all" rather than
  building an empty `IN ()`), unit-list stability under the cursor, and the catalog itself through the real
  Worker against real SQLite: arrival ordering, episode re-bump ordering, per-service filtering, a title on
  several services appearing once dated by its latest arrival, removals hidden, and zero outbound requests.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-09-14

Everything below the "Earlier unreleased entries" heading predates 2026-09-03. What
follows first is the work since: four audit passes (an independent full-repository
review, two adversarial rounds, and the first frontend round that drove a real
browser) and the fixes that came out of them, plus the multi-device sync and count
bugs reported from real use afterwards. Every finding from all four audits is closed;
the reports now live in `docs/history/`.

### 🔒 SEC-001 — personal shelves were readable by anyone who knew a username (2026-09-14)
- **What was wrong**: `creatorsynctracking:{username}` holds an account's Watch History, Continue Watching,
  Watchlist and Airing Next. Four code paths read it and only one asked whether the caller was allowed to.
  `/lists/:username/:slug` consulted the opt-in flags `/api/creator/sync/share-tracking` writes;
  `fetchAutoTrackedCatalog` (every Stremio catalog request **and** every `/api/preview`) and `resolveConfig`
  (whose arrays `/api/resolve` returns wholesale) took the username straight out of a caller-supplied string.
  A single unauthenticated
  `GET /api/preview?type=series&url=autotrack:watch-history:series:<username>` returned the whole shelf, with
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so any web page could read it — and `/lists/public.json` publishes a
  username for every public list, so nothing had to be guessed. README stated the opposite as a guarantee.
- **The gate, now shared**: `mayReadTrackedShelf` (`02_http-and-creator-utils.js`) is the single place that
  answers "may this caller read this shelf", and `fetchAutoTrackedCatalog` calls it — the one point every
  route funnels through, so a caller added later inherits the check instead of having to remember it.
  A shelf is served only to a request that proves it owns the account, or one the owner explicitly shared.
  Airing Next has no share flag, so it is owner-only.
- **Proof, not a claimed name**: `/api/save` now refuses to store a configuration naming a Creator Profile
  (via `trackCreatorName` or an `autotrack:…:<username>` row) unless the request authenticates as it, and
  stamps the verified owner on the stored payload. `resolveConfig` gates its tracking read on that proof.
  A base64 (no-KV) config is caller-authored and can never claim an account.
- **Nothing that works today stops working**: the Creator Key now travels with a config whenever the config
  contains one of that account's personal shelves, not only when Auto-track Playback is on — that shape
  previously carried no credential at all. `/api/preview` call sites send the signed-in account's key.
  Install links minted before this release are still honoured; see `LEGACY_UNVERIFIED_CONFIG_SHELVES`
  (`00_constants.js`) for exactly what that costs and how to close it.
- **Tests**: a dedicated gate test in the Phase 4 suite (anonymous gets nothing for all four slugs, the owner
  gets it, an opted-in shelf is public, a truthy-but-not-`true` flag is not consent), plus
  `audit/full-2026-09-13/p12_sec001_positive.mjs` covering owner links with tracking on and off, legacy
  configs, share and un-share. `loadSourceFunctions` now loads several sources into ONE sandbox, because
  loading `05_` without `02_` is a different program from the concatenated Worker, not a smaller one.

### 🧬 Watch History / Continue Watching could be discarded without saying so (2026-09-14)
- **DB-001 — one duplicated show id discarded the whole write**: `continue_watching` and `airing_next` are
  keyed `(username, show_id)` and their INSERTs carried no `ON CONFLICT`, so a single repeated show id in a
  client-supplied array raised a UNIQUE violation. A D1 batch is one transaction, so that took the meta row,
  the show states, Continue Watching, Airing Next **and** Watch History down with it — and the route answered
  `ok:true`. `watch_history` next door had had `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE` all along. Both tables now upsert,
  and both arrays are deduped server-side on the key they are actually stored under (first occurrence wins,
  matching the client's own `dedupeContinueWatchingItems`).
- **…and the blanket delete that went with it**: every "replace the whole set" was `DELETE WHERE username = ?`
  followed by INSERTs, chunked 80 at a time — so the delete could commit while a later chunk failed, leaving
  the shelf genuinely emptied. Replaced by `d1ReplaceRowsById`: read what is there, upsert everything
  incoming, and delete only the rows that are actually gone, by id, **last**. A failure now leaves stale
  extras — which the next push corrects — instead of a hole.
- **BE-001 — a failed D1 write reported success**: `saveCreatorTrackingD1` returns `false` on failure and the
  value was dropped. Because D1 is what `/api/creator/sync/load` and every personal catalog row read first,
  the browser was told its push had landed, advanced its sync baseline, and then discarded its own unsaved
  copy on the next load. `/api/creator/sync/save-tracking` now writes KV first (so the push survives),
  reports the D1 failure as a 500, and the browser keeps its copy and retries.
- **…and the read now notices when D1 is behind**: `readCreatorTrackingD1` compares its meta stamp against the
  KV blob and hands back the newer copy, repairing D1 in the background — the same repair `getCreatorList`
  has carried for list records since a previous audit.
- **DB-002 / BE-002 — `"tmdb:1399".split(':')[0]` is `"tmdb"`**: three places reduced a show id to its show
  that way. In `/api/creator/sync/save-tracking`'s merge it meant one server-side `tmdb:` entry marked the
  whole namespace handled and dropped every incoming `tmdb:` show behind it (measured: four shows pushed, two
  stored, `ok:true`). In `fetchAutoTrackedCatalog` it matched every `tmdb:` Continue Watching row to the first
  `tmdb:` Airing Next entry, so unrelated shows inherited each other's air dates and season-finale badges.
  One `trackingShowKey` helper now does what the client has always done.
- **BE-004 — the cron wrote a stale snapshot back**: `checkForNewEpisodes` re-read the record before writing
  and then assigned the array it had built from the copy read *before* several seconds of TMDB I/O, so the
  re-read did nothing and a browser save in between was reverted. It now applies only the two edits it
  actually makes — append a newly-aired episode, and take that show out of `fullyWatchedShowIds`.
- **Dead flag removed**: `d1Success` in `/api/creator/lists/save` was assigned in two places and never read.
  The list path deliberately tolerates a failed D1 write (KV holds it and `getCreatorList` repairs on read);
  that is now written down instead of implied by an unused variable.

### 🧹 Reliability, protocol and dead-code fixes (2026-09-14)
- **BE-003 — rotating a leaked webhook token failed open**: `getOrCreateScrobbleToken` logged a failed D1
  rotation and wrote KV anyway. `usernameForScrobbleToken` consults D1 first, so it then found the **old**
  token recorded as active, rejected the new one and kept honouring the old one — the caller was handed a
  token that did not work while the credential they believed they had just revoked carried on authorising
  writes. Rotation now fails closed (the caller already turns that into a 500). A first mint still tolerates a
  D1 miss, because nothing contradicts it and the lazy backfill repairs it.
- **CF-001 — `/admin/api/creator-lists` could exceed the per-invocation storage cap**: `list({ limit: 1000 })`
  with no cursor plus one `get` per key is up to 1,001 operations against Cloudflare's 1,000 limit, and
  anything past the first 1,000 keys was invisible either way. Bounded by
  `ADMIN_CREATOR_LIST_KV_SCAN_MAX` (250), and the response now reports `kvScanTruncated` when it hits it
  instead of implying it saw everything.
- **DB-004 — the search index update was two statements**: FTS5 has no primary key, so updating `lists_fts`
  is delete-then-insert; as two separate awaits, two concurrent saves of one list could interleave into zero
  rows or two, and a failure between them left the list unsearchable silently. Now one `batch`, which is one
  transaction.
- **PROTO-001 — the manifest did not declare an id prefix it serves**: Watch History and Continue Watching
  entries for titles with no IMDb id are `tmdb:<id>`, and `/meta` has always resolved them — but
  `idPrefixes` said only `["tt", "channel_"]`, which is how a Stremio-protocol client decides who owns an id.
  Strict clients filtered those tiles out of the row and no client routed their detail page here. Both
  `idPrefixes` arrays now include `"tmdb:"`.
- **FE-001 — an optimistic dashboard update was never rolled back**: the list reconciliation save used
  `.catch(() => {})` and never looked at `data.ok`, so a refusal the server states plainly (413 over the size
  ceiling, 409 on a conflicting edit) left the dashboard showing items the account does not have. The change
  is now reverted and reported.
- **FE-002 — ~520 lines of unreachable import code removed**: the Trakt-export and Letterboxd-export zip
  importers bound their file inputs with `getElementById('traktExportFileInput')?.addEventListener(...)` at
  script-evaluation time, and neither id exists in the page — optional chaining meant they never attached.
  The unified importer replaced both and reads `.zip` itself. `mapTraktExportEntryToWatchHistoryItem`, the one
  piece the live Trakt history import still calls, was kept.
- **FE-003 — a stale saved sub-tab opened the Lists tab blank**: `#listsSubBulk` was removed from the page but
  the value that selects it is still in people's `localStorage`, and `switchListsSubmenu` hides every panel
  before showing the one it was asked for — so a browser holding `'bulk'` showed nothing, on every load,
  with no way back but clearing site data. The saved value is validated against the panels that exist, in the
  bundle **and** in the pre-paint inline script, since the CSS hides panels before the bundle runs.

### 🔑 A full backup with live credentials was committed to the repository (2026-09-14)
- `my-lists-full-backup1.json` (added in `73f2dd8`) was an exported app backup containing one account's
  **Creator Key** and its live **Trakt, MDBList and Simkl OAuth access tokens** in plain text, in a public
  repository. The file is removed and `.gitignore` now refuses that shape.
- **Removing it does not remove it from git history**, and the repository has a fork. Every credential in it
  must be treated as compromised: reset the Creator Key in the account panel, and revoke the three provider
  tokens at trakt.tv/oauth/applications, mdblist.com/preferences and Simkl's settings.

### ⚡ Performance, hardening, accessibility and docs (2026-09-14)
- **DB-003 — the directory read had no `LIMIT`**: `/lists/public.json` fetched every public list on the
  deployment, running `json_array_length` over each one's `items_json` to count it, then kept 100. Page one
  cost as much as the entire directory, and past a certain size the failure is a D1 response-size error
  rather than a slow page. The page is asked for in SQL now (`LIMIT`/`OFFSET`), the total comes from two
  cheap `COUNT`s, and one read is capped by `PUBLIC_INDEX_MAX_ROWS`.
- **CF-002 — the page memo was keyed on the page**: `SPLIT_PAGE_MEMO` used the whole pre-split HTML string
  (measured at 1,979,374 characters) as its Map key, with the rewritten page as the value, sixteen entries —
  tens of megabytes pinned in an isolate that has 128MB for everything. Keyed on a cheap hash plus length now.
- **Stored install configs are namespaced**: they were written at the bare 12-character id, which made
  `resolveConfig` a read of an *arbitrary* short KV key. Nothing is exposed by that today — every other
  namespace is prefixed and longer — but that is an accident of current key names, not a rule. New configs go
  under `cfg:`; old ones are still read at their bare key, so no install URL changes.
- **`/admin/logout` is POST-only** and the dashboard's control is a form rather than a link. The session
  cookie is `SameSite=Strict`, so this was never reachable cross-site; it was protection by a property of the
  cookie rather than by the method being right.
- **A11Y-001 — keyboard focus was invisible**: seven rules set `outline: none` and nothing put anything back;
  the whole 97KB stylesheet had two `:focus` rules and no `:focus-visible`. Tabbing to the theme toggle, any
  header button, an accordion or a Continue Watching remove button showed nothing (WCAG 2.4.7). A
  `:focus-visible` ring is defined once, last in the cascade.
- **A11Y-002 / A11Y-004** — the 18 icon-only buttons (modal `✕`, the `♡` like button, the row and
  source removers) have accessible names, and all five dialogs are named: the static four by `aria-label`,
  the dynamic one by `aria-labelledby` pointing at the heading `showModal` already focuses.
- **A11Y-003** — a `prefers-reduced-motion` block, against three `@keyframes` and 33 transitions.
- **PWA-001 — the manifest lied about the icon**: two entries claimed 192×192 and 512×512 while
  `/icon.png`'s IHDR says 256×256, so the splash and installed-app icons were upscaled from half the declared
  resolution. Declared at its real size now. No `maskable` entry — that needs an icon drawn for the safe zone,
  which is a design task, not a manifest edit.
- **API-001 documented**: no refresh token is stored for any provider, so a Trakt connection lasts about three
  months and then needs reconnecting. Written down in the README with why it is a storage-model change rather
  than a fix.

### ♻️ "Reset Account Data" undid itself a few hours later (2026-09-14)
- **Reported**: after pressing Reset Account Data everything clears, then hours later the lists, watch
  history, continue watching and presets are all back.
- **Cause**: a reset empties the account but deliberately keeps the identity, so every OTHER browser signed
  into it still holds the whole account in `localStorage`. All five stamps `/api/creator/sync/meta` reports
  then read **0** — which is exactly what a brand-new account reports. Three places treat that as "nothing has
  ever been saved here, so my copy is the first save":
  - `renderCreatorDashboard` uploads every local list the account is missing (`uploadMissingLocalListsToAccount`);
  - `loadCreatorSync`'s presets branch says so outright — *"Server presets are empty: keep local presets and
    push them up"*;
  - the same load re-pushes config, channels and tracking.
  So the next device to wake up put it all back, and nothing anywhere could tell an emptied account from a
  new one. The `/api/creator/sync/meta` poll made it worse: every stamp moves *down* to 0 on a reset, and the
  poll only ever asks whether a stamp moved **up**, so it concluded "nothing changed" and left the stale
  browser holding a full copy.
- **Fix, using machinery that already existed**:
  - `purgeCreatorData` now writes a **deletion tombstone per list** it removes (`recordCreatorListDeletions`),
    which is precisely what `renderCreatorDashboard`'s re-upload guard already consults — so the lists cannot
    come back.
  - It also records a **reset stamp** (`creatorreset:{username}`, `CREATOR_RESET_TTL_SEC` = 90 days), returned
    by `/api/creator/account/reset`, `/api/creator/sync/load` and `/api/creator/sync/meta`. A device that has
    not seen that stamp clears its local copy instead of uploading it, records the stamp, and stays signed in
    on the now-blank account.
  - The poll checks `resetAt` separately from the four stamps, because it is the one signal that counts *down*.
- **Gated on an explicit `recordReset` option**, not on "this was not a delete": `/api/creator/create` runs the
  same sweep as a pre-create purge, and marking every brand-new account as just-reset would have made the
  browser that created it wipe itself on its first sync. (The regression tests caught exactly that.)
- Deleting an account still writes no marker — there is no account left to announce it to, and the key stops
  authenticating.

### 🌌 Storylines, Sagas & Universes Watch Order in Item Details (2026-09-12)
- **Chronological watch order display at bottom of Item Details**:
  - When clicking any poster to inspect details (`openItemDetailsModal`), the modal automatically detects whether the title belongs to any canon saga, trilogy, or franchise universe in `TV_CROSSOVER_EVENTS`.
  - If matched, renders a dedicated **Storylines, Sagas & Universes** section beneath the overview, trailer, and seasons list displaying the saga name, franchise metadata, description, and an "Open Saga" button.
  - Displays a clean horizontal scrolling shelf (`storyline-posters-scroll`) of all installments in narrative watch order with part badges (`Part 1`, `Part 2`, etc.), poster artwork with fallback resolution, format labels (e.g., `Movie`, `Seasons 1-5`, `S2E8`), and watched checkmark indicators.
  - Distinctively highlights the currently active item with `.item-storyline-card.is-current` styling, an accent border (`var(--accent)`), ambient glow, and a high-contrast `"Current"` badge.
  - Interactive navigation: Clicking any non-active installment invokes `openItemDetailsModal(...)` for that specific title, allowing users to seamlessly browse through the entire chronological storyline step by step.
  - Multi-storyline support: If a title belongs to multiple sagas or crossover events (e.g. *The Flash* in the Arrowverse), renders subnav pill tabs (`switchItemStorylineTab`) allowing instant switching between storylines.

### 📺 Mark Show Watched & Unwatched Button Fixes (2026-09-12)
- **Button Renaming**: Changed "Mark Whole Show Watched" to **"Mark Show Watched"** and "Mark Whole Show Unwatched" to **"Mark Show Unwatched"**.
- **Fixed "Mark Show Unwatched" button failure**:
  - Captured intent directly from the button element's state (`secondary` class or `"Unwatched"` label) so clicking to unwatch always passes `forceUnwatch: true` to `toggleBatchWatchStatus` rather than relying on inconsistent single-ID checks in `_fullyWatchedShowIds`.
  - Enhanced episode unwatch filtering in `toggleBatchWatchStatus` to match both raw numeric TMDB episode IDs and composite string IDs (`showId:s:e`, `imdbId:s:e`, `tmdbId:s:e`), ensuring all episodes of the show are thoroughly removed from `watch-history`.
  - Updated `setShowFullyWatched` to synchronize all show aliases (`id`, `imdbId`, `tmdbId`, `'tmdb:' + tmdbId`) in `_fullyWatchedShowIds`.
- **Fixed show button not reverting when a season is marked unwatched**:
  - Added `isShowFullyWatched(d)` helper to accurately check whether all non-specials seasons are fully watched.
  - In `toggleSeasonWatched`, updated `btnMarkShowWatched` using the freshly evaluated `allSeasonsWatched` state rather than `isItemWatched()`, immediately reverting the button to "Mark Show Watched" (with `primary` class) if any season is unwatched.
  - Refined `isItemWatched()` to check item-specific IDs rather than matching any item sharing `it.showId`, preventing partial episode watch history from falsifying whole-show watched status.

### 🎬 Continue Watching Storyline & Companion Recommendations (2026-09-12)
- **Automatic recommendation of companion movies, bridge films, and sequel/spinoff series in Continue Watching.**
  - **Narrative Bridge Movies Between Seasons**: When a user completes a season that precedes a canon bridge movie (e.g., *Demon Slayer* S1 finale &rarr; *Demon Slayer: Mugen Train*, *The X-Files* S5 &rarr; *Fight the Future*, *24* S6 &rarr; *Redemption*, *Power Rangers Zeo* &rarr; *Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie*), Continue Watching automatically recommends the bridge movie instead of jumping straight to the next season premiere.
  - **Sequel Films and Spinoff Series on Show Conclusion**: When a user finishes the series finale of a show (e.g. *Breaking Bad* S5 finale), Continue Watching automatically injects the sequel film (*El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie*). When the user finishes or marks the sequel film watched in Watch History, Continue Watching advances to the next narrative installment or spinoff series (*Better Call Saul* S1E1). Also supports standalone finales like *Deadwood: The Movie*, *Serenity*, *Downton Abbey*, *The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die*, *Psych*, *Monk*, etc.
  - **User Enable/Disable Setting**: Added a dedicated "Storyline & Companion Recommendations" toggle in the Settings tab under *Watch History & Continue Watching*, backed by `localStorage['myListAddon:autoRecommendCompanions']` (default: enabled). When disabled, zero companion suggestions are injected.
  - **Dismissal and Sequential Advancement**: Companion recommendations can be dismissed via the card's `&times;` button, recording the dismissal in `_dismissedContinueWatching`. Dismissing a companion halts recommendation for that storyline point without prematurely skipping ahead to later installments.
  - **Design System Badges**: Added distinct `cw-date-badge-companion` badge labels (e.g. "Bridge Movie", "Sequel Film", "Next Series in Storyline") using design system tokens (`var(--accent)`), rendered consistently across Custom List cards (`buildLocalListCardHtml`) and Live Preview poster tiles (`livePreviewPosterHtml`).
  - **D1 & Sync Round-Trip Persistence**: Fixed an issue where the companion badge disappeared after sync. D1 relational table `continue_watching` now encodes companion metadata into `show_title` as `COMPANION:{...}`, safely preserving `isCompanion`, `companionType`, `companionNote`, `companionStoryline`, and `precedingShowId` across D1 and Creator Sync without breaking the database schema.
  - **Immediate Companion Injection & Completed Show Eviction**: Fixed an issue where marking a show watched did not immediately recommend the companion item or remove the completed show from Continue Watching. `markShowWatched` now synchronously evicts all aliases of the completed show and injects the storyline companion into Continue Watching, immediately refreshing local storage and the creator dashboard.
  - **Completed Show Exclusion & Catalog Routing**: `fetchAutoTrackedCatalog` in `05_catalog-core.js` now queries `creator_show_states` for `is_fully_watched = 1` and excludes completed shows from Continue Watching in both D1 and KV fallback paths. Companion movies are now properly categorized as `type: 'movie'` and routed to Movie catalogs rather than Series catalogs.
  - **Stremio & Nuvio Companion Poster Badges**: Added `companion` query parameter support to `/api/poster-badge` and `applyBadgedPostersToMetas`, rendering dynamic blue accent companion badges directly on catalog poster artwork in Stremio and Nuvio.
  - **Item Compaction Preservation**: Updated `compactCustomListItem` in `22_client-creator-profile.js` to preserve `isCompanion`, `companionType`, `companionNote`, `companionStoryline`, and `precedingShowId` across local storage compaction and quota passes.

### 🔍 Search resilience (2026-09-11)
- **Title search resilience against typos, missing spaces, and merged words.**
  - Added `generateSearchVariations` in `25_api-catalog-routes.js` to automatically generate query candidates for merged words (`pickup` &rarr; `pick up`), glued numbers (`matrix4` &rarr; `matrix 4`), camelCase words, and hyphen variations when TMDB direct search returns no results.
  - Added Cinemeta fuzzy/trigram search fallback in `/api/title-search`: when TMDB returns 0 results for a misspelled or deformed title, Cinemeta's elastic index matches the title and resolves matching IMDB IDs via TMDB `/3/find/`, returning rich TMDB results for previously zero-hit queries like *"Is it wrong to pickup girls in the dungeon"*, *"Interstelar"*, or *"Breakingbad"*.
  - Added query variations fallback to `executeUnifiedListSearch` (`19_client-search-and-likes.js`) so list searches also catch merged words.

### 🔍 Content filter (2026-09-11)
- **Adult content filter now correctly blocks NSFW results in the Lists search tab.** Searching "Lists" for an adult collection (e.g. "Top Wet Girls") previously returned results with raw NSFW posters. Fixed by:
  - `/api/tmdb-search-lists` now passes `&include_adult=true` to TMDB's collection search (so adult collections surface at all), detects each collection's adult status via both the `adult` boolean flag and `isAdultOrNsfw()` keyword matching, and replaces the poster with a safe placeholder when the adult content filter is active.
  - The client's `fetchListSearchResults()` now appends `&adultContentFilter=1` to the `/api/tmdb-search-lists` request when the filter is enabled, so the server knows to apply safe-poster logic.
  - `mapTmdbItem()` (`07_source-fetchers-tmdb-simkl.js`) now calls `isAdultOrNsfw()` in its `isAdult` calculation so items whose TMDB `adult` flag is absent but whose title matches explicit keywords are still tagged correctly.
  - Preserved `adult`, `isAdult`, `genres`, and `certification` fields through `extractMdblistItem()` and `mapMdblistItems()` in `06_source-fetchers-mdblist-trakt.js`, and restored the `releaseYear` variable that was accidentally dropped from `extractMdblistItem()` during that change.
  - Previously added (prior session): `isAdultOrNsfw()` keyword detection on both worker-side (`05_catalog-core.js`) and client-side (`19_client-search-and-likes.js`), safe poster substitution via `resolveClientPoster()`, adult detection in `fetchTmdbCollection()`, and `adultContentFilter` propagation through `fetchCatalog()` and `/api/title-search`.

### 🔒 Security & privacy
- **Cross-account data destruction (critical).** An account purge built its D1 delete from a SQL `LIKE` pattern containing the username, and `_` is LIKE's single-character wildcard — so deleting the account `a_c-films` also deleted every list belonging to `abc-films`, `axc-films` and so on. Usernames of all underscores are legal, so this needed no credentials to weaponise. Now an indexed equality on the username column.
- **Stored XSS via imported lists (critical).** Ids from an imported list or channel were interpolated into markup unescaped, so opening a shared list could execute script in the victim's page and read their Creator Key out of `localStorage`. Escaped at every sink, with the delivery path closed.
- **One account's data under another account's name.** Signing in as a second account while the first account's sync response was still in flight rendered the first account's lists, liked lists and catalog rows under the second account's name. A load now checks it still belongs to the account that asked for it.
- **Signup published your Watchlist.** Creating a profile migrated local lists to the account — including the Watchlist, as `public`. It migrates privately now, and creating a profile while already signed in no longer moves the previous account's lists into the new one.
- **Support threads were an open mailbox.** Thread ids were `Math.random()` (~31 bits, recoverable state) and granted read access to free-text reports plus the contact address the form asks for; anyone could also append to any thread and choose the sender name shown. Ids are now 72 bits of CSPRNG, appends to an account's thread require that account's key, the sender is proven rather than claimed, and the lookup endpoint is rate-limited.
- **Account takeover by guessing the recovery answer.** The only throttle was per-IP, which rotating IPs defeat. Added a per-account daily failure budget (atomic on D1), a minimum entropy requirement on the answer at creation, and the same budget on the other credential endpoints.
- **A deleted account could still authenticate.** A colo holding a cached pre-deletion record kept accepting the old key. A strongly-consistent D1 tombstone (`creator_tombstones`) now answers that from anywhere on the next request.
- **Private lists were visible to a probe.** `/api/lists/like` answered differently for a private list than for one that does not exist. Both now return the same generic 404.
- **Media-server webhooks stopped carrying your key.** Plex/Nuvio scrobble URLs contained `creator` + `key` in the query string. They now use a scoped, revocable token that authorises exactly one thing — recording playback — and is revoked when the account is deleted. Existing key URLs keep working, because they are sitting inside people's media servers.
- **SSRF and open redirect** closed in the poster-badge endpoint; `/api/preview` URLs allowlisted; CORS `*` dropped from creator and like JSON; the fflate script from jsDelivr integrity-pinned; admin 401s and every other error response made uncacheable; every account-scoped response moved onto a private-by-default helper at the boundary, so a new route cannot forget.
- **Admin key comparison no longer leaks its length** — both sides are digested first, so the comparison runs over the same length whatever was submitted.

### 🔁 Multi-device sync
- **An installed PWA no longer overwrites the account with its stale copy.** A re-launched PWA begins with no idea what version the account is on, and its start-up timers reached the save endpoints before the first load answered — so changes made on the desktop (a removed Watch History item, a dismissed Continue Watching show, a deleted list, an edited catalog row) came back a few minutes later on the phone. Pushes now wait for the first load, the versions each push cites survive a page load, and `save-tracking` refuses a push built on a version another browser has already replaced.
- **A list deleted on one device stays deleted on the others.** The account now records its own deletions, so a browser still holding a local copy drops it instead of helpfully uploading it back.
- **A resumed device no longer re-adds what another device removed** from Watch History, Continue Watching or the Watchlist.
- **A list changed on another device now refreshes on resume** — the resume poll gained a fifth stamp for custom lists, which the four sync-blob stamps could never have carried.
- **Two devices editing one list** no longer silently lose the older edit: the same conflict guard the sync blobs have, extended to the list write, with the version reported back on save.
- **Concurrent list creation stopped dropping list-order entries** (12 creations, 12 records, 9 order entries before; 12 now).

### 📋 Lists, counts and Discover
- **See All shows the list's real size.** A 303-item chart said "100 items" — the first page's length, printed as a total, and pinned there when a Discover card handed the same 100 through as an exact count. Trakt's own item count is now carried through, a total that the loaded items have overtaken is discarded, and a source that cannot report one says "100+" until the last page lands.
- **See All shows the real size for TMDB and MDBList too.** The Trakt fix above only ever landed for Trakt. Two things kept the others on "100 until you scroll": TMDB's user lists and collections never reported a total at all, and the ones that did (MDBList lists, every TMDB chart) had it thrown away by the cache — a count hung on an array does not survive `JSON.stringify`, so it survived a hit in isolate memory and vanished on a KV or edge hit. The count now travels beside the rows in the cached envelope, TMDB lists report an exact total whenever one is knowable, and collections report their own length.
- **Runaway duplicate lists.** One account had 129 list records for 22 real lists (44 copies of one of them) because a save that asked for a slug was silently given a different one and the dashboard re-uploaded the "missing" list forever. The save is idempotent now, the dashboard cannot loop, and the orphan sweep recovers records whose order entry was lost.
- **Never allocate a slug that is already taken** — publishing a 501st list called "Movies" used to replace the contents of `movies-500`.
- Channel "See All" gives every episode its own id instead of collapsing a show into one tile; Trakt popular lists are typed correctly and addressed by slug; imported lists keep their name and type when the URL carries a query string; episode and season posters fall back to the show's artwork when the specific image is missing.
- Removing one Watch History item no longer rebuilds the whole grid, and a grouped show tile removes from the list it is actually in.
- **Trakt community lists and See All preview resiliency.** An expired or invalid personal Trakt access token (such as one restored from an old backup) no longer causes public Trakt community lists on Discover or search to fail with 401/403 errors ("Couldn't load previews for this list." / "Couldn't load that list."). The worker automatically falls back to unauthenticated public fetches on 401/403, and the client scopes `traktAccessToken` strictly to the user's own account lists.
- **Watch History episode still backfill negative caching.** Fixed console 404 spam for shows without episode stills or seasons on TMDB (e.g. WWE SmackDown `tt9568676`) by recording 404 responses in `myListAddon:episodeStillChecks`, caching show-level missing status, and serializing checks per show to prevent redundant parallel requests.
- **Broken poster image fallback.** Added `onerror="handlePosterImgError(this)"` to list card mini posters so broken external or Metahub URLs fall back to title tiles without logging errors.
- **Discover panel layout unification and Curated Collections removal.** Unified all Discover subnav tabs (`All`, `Movies`, `Shows`, `Popular Lists`, `Curated`, `Hidden Gems`, `Kids`, `Holidays`, `Genres`) to wrap their headers, descriptions, and list feeds in a main `<div class="panel">` container matching the `Channels -> My Channels` layout instead of disconnected floating card headers. Removed the static "Curated Collections" section from Discover's Curated feed in favor of personalized recommendation shelves.
- **Large channel storage quota ladder & "See All" resolution.** Fixed repetitive browser `QuotaExceededError` exceptions when creating or syncing large virtual TV channels (up to 5,000 items) by implementing an in-memory cache, `sessionStorage` mirroring, stripped duplicate URLs (`thumbnail`, `showPoster`), and a multi-tier storage ladder (full map -> 1000 items -> 300 items -> session fallback) in `saveLocalChannelsMap`. Enhanced `openChannelDetailsPage` and `renderMyCreatedChannelsList` with multi-tier lookup (memory cache, map values, `#lists` rows) and clickable titles so channels with thousands of items reliably open in "See All" and never enter repeated synchronization loops.
- **Continue Watching badge enrichment for Stremio and Nuvio.** `fetchAutoTrackedCatalog` in `05_catalog-core.js` now cross-references `airing_next` records (from both D1 and KV) for matching shows, enriching Continue Watching items with upcoming `airDate`, `isSeasonPremiere`, `isSeasonFinale`, `seasonFinaleAirDate`, and `seasonFinaleEpisodeNumber`. Downstream `applyBadgedPostersToMetas` now generates badged poster URLs (`/api/poster-badge?...`) for Stremio and Nuvio catalogs, matching the badges in Live Preview & Editor.
- **Season "Mark Season Watched" button false-positive fix.** In `19_client-search-and-likes.js`, `isSeasonFullyWatched` previously checked the global show-level `window._fullyWatchedShowIds.has(sid)`. Because `_fullyWatchedShowIds` tracks show-level catchup/dismissal state, checking it caused past unwatched seasons (e.g. NCIS Season 6) to flip from `Mark Season Watched` to `✓ Mark Season Unwatched` as soon as season episodes were expanded. Removed the show-level check from `isSeasonFullyWatched`, guarded against empty episode sets, and ensured accurate season watch detection.
- **Trakt lists with seasons/episodes and TMDB collection preview resolution.** Trakt custom lists containing season and episode entities (such as *Popular Returning TV Shows*) previously returned 0 items because `/items/shows` filtered out all non-show entries; `fetchTrakt` now queries `/items/shows,seasons,episodes` when `type: "series"`, and `mapTraktItems` resolves season/episode entities to their parent show's IMDb or TMDB ID. TMDB collections and lists containing items lacking IMDb IDs (such as *New Tunnel Warfare*) now preserve `tmdb:<id>` rather than dropping items. `fetchPreviewForSlot` in `19_client-search-and-likes.js` falls back to the alternate media type if the primary type returns 0 items, and `loadPosterSlot` renders an informative empty state ("No items found in this list.") when a list is legitimately empty instead of failing into an error state with an unrecoverable Retry button.
- **TV Crossover, Companion Movie & Anime Canon Event Registry Expansion.** Added 56 verified crossover events, TV-to-movie sequels/prequels, and anime canon bridge movies to `TV_CROSSOVER_EVENTS` in `20_client-channel-builder.js` from `crossover_and_companion_guide.md`. Covers live-action continuations (*Peacemaker/The Suicide Squad*, *The Batman/The Penguin*, *Battlestar Galactica Miniseries*, *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*, *Twin Peaks*, *Veronica Mars*, *Power Rangers Zeo/Turbo*, *The Transformers 1986*, *Sex and the City*, *Monk*, *Luther*, *Burn Notice*, *Farscape*, *CSI: Immortality*, *The Sopranos/The Many Saints of Newark*, *Entourage*, *The Librarians*, *Gomorrah/L'immortale*, *Spartacus*, *The Venture Bros.*, *Metalocalypse*), animated series with canon movies (*The Simpsons Movie*, *South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut*, *The Bob's Burgers Movie*, *Batman: Mask of the Phantasm*, *Steven Universe*, *Tangled: Before Ever After*, *Lilo & Stitch*, *Jimmy Neutron*, *Rugrats Trilogy*, *Beavis and Butt-Head Do America*, *Buzz Lightyear of Star Command*), multi-show crossover events (*Scandal/HTGAWM*, *The Simpsons Guy*, *Scoobynatural*, *X-Cops*, *That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana*, *Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana*, *Jimmy Timmy Power Hour Trilogy*, *iParty with Victorious*, *Ben 10 & Generator Rex: Heroes United*, *The Grim Adventures of the KND*), and anime canon continuation films (*Dragon Ball Super: Broly & Super Hero*, *Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul*, *KonoSuba: Legend of Crimson*, *Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale*, *Rascal Does Not Dream*, *Steins;Gate: Load Region of Déjà Vu*, *The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya*, *Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle*, *The Quintessential Quintuplets Movie*, *Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door*, *Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) / Conqueror of Shamballa*, *Gintama: The Very Final*, *No Game No Life: Zero*, *Isekai Quartet*). All entries feature verified IMDb/TMDB IDs, Metahub poster URLs, story-order sequence indices, reactive Channel Builder suggestions with 1-click splicing into draft lineups, and updated `getStorylineCategories` mapping for genre filtering in *Storylines & Universes*.
- **Anime Unpacking: Restoring Multi-Season Division for Compressed Anime Shows.** Fixes TMDB cataloging that compresses entire anime series into a single monolithic season (e.g. *MASHLE: MAGIC AND MUSCLES* 24 episodes into Season 1 [12 eps] and Season 2 [12 eps], *Re:ZERO* 85 episodes into S1–S4, *Jujutsu Kaisen* 59 episodes into S1–S2). Fixed a critical condition in `resolveUnpackedShowData` that skipped fetching `/tv/{id}/episode_groups` when TMDB `/tv/{id}` returned no preloaded groups. Filtered out unreleased/announced placeholder stub seasons from Cinemeta fallback responses. Added automatic multi-season cache upgrading in `fetchTmdbItemDetails` so shows cached in KV or memory before unpacking immediately upgrade to multi-season structures across `/api/details`, `/api/show-seasons`, `/api/show-episodes`, and `/api/season`.
- **Continue Watching Older Season Badge Suppression in Live Preview & Editor.** Fixed an issue where Continue Watching cards for shows on older seasons (e.g. *Grand Blue Dreaming* watched on Season 2 while Season 3 is airing) incorrectly displayed season finale badges (e.g. `FINALE: SEP 22`) in Live Preview & Editor. `/api/preview` now carries `showId`, `seasonNum`, `episodeNum`, and badge flags in sample items; `livePreviewPosterHtml` and `renderCreatorPreviewCards` compute `effectiveSeasonNum` with fallback to `season` and local Continue Watching storage rather than falling back to the airing season; `05_catalog-core.js` and client preview renderers enforce `isOlderSeason` to explicitly strip and suppress finale/premiere badges whenever the watched season is older than the currently airing season.
- **Continue Watching Current Season Episode 1 Finale Badge & Premiere Consistency.** Fixed an issue where Continue Watching did not display the upcoming season finale badge (e.g. `FINALE: SEP 22`) on Episode 1 of the current season (e.g. *Grand Blue Dreaming* S3E1 "Unfinished Business") after watching the last episode of the previous season. Previously, the client required marking Episode 1 as watched (`currentEpNum >= 2`) and `advanceContinueWatchingShow` in `21_client-custom-list-builder.js` unconditionally treated any Episode 1 as an un-aired premiere (`isPremiere`), clearing `seasonFinaleAirDate`. Updated `advanceContinueWatchingShow` to set `isPremiere` only when Episode 1 has not yet aired (`!aired`), preserving `seasonFinaleAirDate`. In `05_catalog-core.js`, corrected `isSameEpisode` check to match both `seasonNum` and `episodeNum` (preventing Continue Watching Episode 1 from inheriting future air dates from Airing Next Episode 11), and restricted `isSeasonPremiere` to unaired future episodes. Updated `livePreviewPosterHtml` (`23_client-list-management.js`) and `buildLocalListCardHtml` (`22_client-creator-profile.js`) so that already-aired Episode 1s on the current season reliably display the upcoming `Finale: [Date]` badge and do not display a Season Premiere badge, ensuring badge consistency between Your Custom Lists and Live Preview & Editor.
- **Adult Content Filter & Safe Poster Replacement (like `aiometadata`).** Added a dedicated "Adult Content & Poster Safety" toggle in Settings (`adultContentFilterCheckbox`) to filter NSFW posters and replace unfiltered default posters with safe, age-appropriate vector poster artwork across all catalogs, preview cards, search results, Continue Watching, and Watch History. Supports seamless persistence via `localStorage` (`myListAddon:adultContentFilter`), configuration short-links, and profile sync payloads. The worker generates high-quality SVG posters on `/api/safe-poster` displaying the title, release year, media type, and age-appropriate certification badges (e.g. `NC-17`, `X`, `XXX`, `R18+`, `18+`, `RX`) with an active safety shield indicator. Automatically detects adult content by explicit flags (`adult`, `isAdult`), adult certifications, and NSFW genres (`Hentai`, `Ecchi`, `Erotica`, etc.), and dynamically replaces posters in Stremio/Nuvio catalog feeds, `/api/preview`, Live Preview & Editor, and dashboard card renderers.


### ⌨️ Frontend, accessibility and offline
- **The admin dashboard was dead for two days.** A single backslash inside a template literal turned the whole 60 KB inline script into one `SyntaxError`, and nothing in CI rendered that page. It renders and is syntax-checked now, along with the builder page and the service worker.
- **Modals are usable from a keyboard**: Escape closes, focus is trapped and restored, ARIA roles are correct, and the scroll lock actually locks (it never had) and is always released.
- **The PWA opens offline** — the service worker warms the shell on install, serves it when the network fails, and cannot pin a stale build.
- A restored backup can no longer permanently kill the Discover feed; an obsolete search response can no longer overwrite a newer one; a non-array `dashboardListOrder` no longer takes down the dashboard; the "Settings" label is no longer clipped at 320px.
- **Tabs no longer nudge the whole page sideways.** Discover › Hidden Gems, Catalogs › Bulk Add, Lists › Liked and Import, and Channels › Quick Add and Import are all short enough to fit without scrolling; the classic scrollbar went away with them and the centred page slid right. The scrollbar gutter is reserved for the document now, so the layout no longer depends on which tab is showing.
- **The installed PWA's system bars follow dark mode.** The status bar and the strip holding the home indicator stayed white however dark the page was, because the document never declared its colour scheme and never reached into the safe areas. It declares `color-scheme` in both themes, paints the root canvas, and `viewport-fit=cover` finally makes the `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding this app has always written mean something. The guide page got the same treatment — it opens inside the PWA too.
- **The Search tab stops reloading itself.** Coming back from a poster, from See All or from another tab re-ran the whole default view — a round trip, plus one `/api/preview` per card on the Lists chip — and so did every press of the Movies / Shows / Lists chips, in both directions. What was rendered is kept and re-shown; only a change to the chip, the query or a filter goes back to the network.
- **The four odd buttons in Settings match the rest.** Open the Guide, Buy me a coffee, Try TorBox Debrid and Import were accent blue with white text. The two links needed a class pair to get there: `button, .actions a` is more specific than a bare `.lc-btn`, so no modifier class on an `<a>` inside `.actions` could reach them.
- **A double-clicked signup** no longer creates an account nobody can sign into.
- **Provider writes that were refused are reported as refused**, instead of being shown as success.

### 🛠️ Admin & operations
- **D1-authoritative admin creator list & published list browse and delete:** `/admin/api/creator-lists` now queries the D1 `creator_lists` table directly (matching Phase 2 authoritative storage), resolves username aliases and display names (e.g. matching `canadutchy` and `cana-dutchy`), and merges with any unmigrated/phantom KV records. `/admin/api/delete-creator-list` and `deleteCreatorLists` accurately recognize D1 deletions using `meta.changes`, report deleted items under `deleted` rather than `missing`, and accurately report remaining counts from D1. The admin UI automatically refreshes remaining lists upon deletion. `/admin/api/published-lists` also falls back to D1 `published_lists` when KV keys are absent.
- **Browse a creator's lists.** The delete tool takes exact slugs and nothing could tell an operator what they were — unworkable against an account carrying dozens of copies of one list under unguessable slugs. The admin panel now lists the stored records (including ones missing from the creator's display order, flagged), filters by name, and selects them all.
- **Anonymously published lists can be removed.** `publishedlist:user:*` had no delete path in any route; there is now a paged browse and a delete that shares the record, ledger and directory sweep with the creator path.
- **A failed delete says what it removed** before it stopped, instead of only "Failed".
- **The Worker can say when it is running ahead of its own database** (`/admin/api/schema-status`), and the KV→D1 migration is resumable and repairs stale rows rather than only inserting missing ones.
- The public list directory is re-derived daily, rebuilt in resumable chunks, and no longer breaks permanently past ~500 lists; making a list private takes it out of the directory immediately, even if the index write fails.

### ⚙️ Performance & reliability
- **D1-backed normalized creator sync and tracking tables (Phase 4).**
  - **Relational tracking tables (`watch_history`, `continue_watching`, `airing_next`, `creator_show_states`, `creator_tracking_meta`):** Split monolithic per-user sync blob `creatorsynctracking:{user}` into 5 relational tables. Endpoints `/api/creator/sync/load`, `/api/creator/sync/save-tracking`, `/api/creator/sync/meta`, `/api/creator/track-status`, `/api/creator/scrobble`, and `handleSubtitlesTrack` read and write through D1 with KV write-through mirroring. Conflict detection compares incoming `client_version` directly against `creator_tracking_meta.client_version`.
  - **User lists table (`creator_user_lists`):** Extracted `likedLists`, `hiddenLists`, and `hiddenSections` from monolithic `creatorsync:{user}` into relational `creator_user_lists` table with `list_type: 'liked' | 'hidden' | 'hidden_section'`. Read and updated via `/api/creator/sync/load`, `/api/creator/sync/save`, and `/api/creator/sync/like`.
  - **Auto-tracked catalog queries (`fetchAutoTrackedCatalog`):** Directly queries `watch_history`, `continue_watching`, and `airing_next` using indexed lookups, bypassing monolithic KV blob parsing and pagination.
  - **Background episode checker (`checkForNewEpisodes`):** Reads and updates Continue Watching and show states directly in D1 with KV write-through.
  - **Account deletion purge (`purgeCreatorData`):** Drops all rows across all 6 Phase 4 tables upon account reset or deletion.
  - **Database monitor & backfill:** `/admin/api/schema-status` monitors row counts for all 6 tables. Extended `/admin/api/migrate-d1` with phases 9 (`creatorsynctracking:`) and 10 (`creatorsync:`). Adds migration `0010_add_phase4_sync_tables.sql`.
- **D1-backed likes ledger, feedback, telemetry metadata, scrobble tokens, and tombstone pruning (Phase 3).**
  - **Likes ledger (`list_likes`):** Rewrote `applyLikeVote` and `readLikeVoters` to use the `list_likes` table with KV fallback, lazy migration on read/vote, and bidirectional mirroring. Maintains denormalized `creator_lists.likes` and `published_lists.likes` counts. Cleared on list deletes and account purges.
  - **Support feedback (`feedback`):** Replaced KV `feedback:*` prefix scans with direct queries against the D1 `feedback` table for admin feedback dashboard, reply, status, edit, and delete endpoints. Client `/api/feedback` and `/api/feedback/threads` write and query D1 with KV mirroring.
  - **Telemetry & metadata (`event_meta`, `stats`):** Added `event_meta` table for tracked event metadata (`writeEventMetaIfChanged`, `attachEventMeta`). Exploded monolithic `stats:genres:alltime` and `stats:decades:alltime` blobs into atomic rows (`genre:{name}`, `decade:{n}`) in `stats`. Updated `computeAudienceAnalytics` to read normalized rows directly from D1 `stats`.
  - **Scrobble tokens (`scrobble_tokens`):** Scrobble token generation (`getOrCreateScrobbleToken`) executes atomic rotation (`DELETE` old + `INSERT` new) in D1 to prevent stale revocation windows across colos. `usernameForScrobbleToken` queries D1 first to eliminate revocation staleness. Purged on account deletion.
  - **Tombstone pruning:** Added `pruneTombstones` to scheduled cron job (`scheduled()`), cleaning up expired tombstone rows (`until < Date.now()`) from `creator_tombstones` and `list_tombstones` while preserving all telemetry, analytics, and feedback data indefinitely per storage retention policies.
  - **Database monitor & backfill:** `/admin/api/schema-status` returns `databaseStats` (page size, page count, estimated size, and table row counts). Extended `/admin/api/migrate-d1` with phases 5–8 (`listlikevoters:*`, `feedback:*`, `evtmeta:*`, `creatorscrobbletoken:*`) and automatic exploding of genre/decade blobs in phase 4. Adds migration `0009_add_phase3_tables.sql`.
- **D1-authoritative identity and creator lists (Phase 2).** Inverted identity and list read paths: `getCreator` and `getCreatorList` query D1 first as the source of truth with lazy backfill on KV fallback, and write to KV as a read-through cache with self-healing of D1 from fresher KV edits. Removed legacy `authoritativeKeyHash` verification. Replaced KV `creatorlastseen:` writes with direct D1 `creators.last_active` updates throttled by an in-memory isolate memo. Added `sort_order` column to `creator_lists` (driving list display order in `/api/creator/lists` and `/api/creator/lists/reorder` to resolve concurrent list creation race conditions), `lists_stamp` and `share_json` to `creators`, and `list_tombstones` table (`migrations/0008_add_list_tombstones_and_creator_columns.sql`) replacing `creatorlistdeleted:{username}`.
- **D1-backed public list directory and search index (Phase 1).** Retired the legacy 32-shard KV public list index (`index:publiclists*`), build lock, and scheduled cron rebuild step in favor of a direct D1 `UNION ALL` query over `creator_lists` and `published_lists` (filtered by `visibility = 'public'` and ordered by `likes DESC, updated_at DESC`). List search (`/api/search-published-lists`) now queries SQLite FTS5 (`lists_fts`), populated on list saves and rebuildable via `/admin/api/rebuild-search-index`. Adds `published_lists` table (`migrations/0006_add_published_lists.sql`) and `lists_fts` virtual table (`migrations/0007_add_lists_fts.sql`).
- **An empty reply from a provider can no longer erase a good chart.** A soft-failed upstream answering `200` with nothing counted as a successful refresh and overwrote all three cache tiers at once, exactly when the circuit breaker was needed. Now refused for the caches a provider owns, while a user's own (legitimately empty) list is unaffected.
- Outbound requests are bounded by a timeout; the cron got the same exception boundary the request path has, isolates each account so one failure costs only itself, and advances its cursor over exactly the accounts it processed.
- Two missing database indexes added; the admin counter panels lost a full table scan and a sort.
- The channel image endpoints are bounded and cacheable; the TMDB fan-out endpoints are rate-limited even when the caller supplies their own key.

### 🧪 Testing & CI
- The suite went from 106 tests to **389**, and now covers the client: `tests/client-harness.mjs` evaluates the real builder bundle against a DOM stub, so payload shapes, response handling and state transitions can be tested without a browser.
- The D1 mock was replaced with **real SQLite**, which is what made the whole first adversarial round's findings testable at all — the mock hardcoded one query to return no rows, could never throw, and could not enforce a constraint.
- `verify.sh` and CI now render and validate the builder page, the admin page and the service worker, check that every inline handler resolves, and fail on `FUNCTION-MAP.md` drift.
- Mutation testing is part of the record: every fix was verified twice — the probe that demonstrated the defect passes, and the defect reintroduced by mutation makes the suite fail.

### Earlier unreleased entries
- **Performance:** Fixed account login and navigation lag for accounts with 1000+ items in Watch History by caching parsed tracking payloads in memory (`_memoryCustomListsObj`) and eliminating repetitive main-thread JSON string re-parsing.
- **Fix:** Fixed a runtime crash in `loadCreatorSync` (`ReferenceError: localOnly is not defined`) during tracking sync unpack.
- **Performance:** Restored 0ms instant tab switching and in-memory Discover feeds caching (`_discoverFeedsCache`), matching production smoothness.
- **Fix:** Enhanced `compactCustomListMap` storage compaction to permanently eliminate browser `QuotaExceededError` when saving large accounts.
- **Feature:** Improved list search with external source name search (MDBList, Trakt, TMDB, Simkl, Profile, Streaming), external creator username search, multi-token relevance scoring, and source badges.
- **Fix:** Fixed Mark Season Watched button state resetting on refresh and fixed episode checkmarks lingering after clicking Mark Season Unwatched.
- **UI:** Renamed "Creator Profile" to "Profile" across all user-facing interface text, prompts, alerts, and FAQs.
- **Fix:** Fixed browser refresh on Custom Lists returning user to the "My Lists" tab page or dropping items.
- **Fix:** Fixed Continue Watching "See All" items disappearing upon clicking the browser refresh button.
- **Fix:** Fixed Continue Watching fast queue race condition (adding both watchHistory and continueWatching to creatorscrobblequeue).
- **Fix:** Fixed Plex scrobbles using show poster instead of episode still thumbnail in Watch History.

- **Fix:** Plex & Nuvio Continue Watching progression and Plex watched checkmarks.
  - Resolved Continue Watching progression failure: fixed a server-merge race condition in `/api/creator/sync/save-tracking` where incoming browser tracking syncs were overwriting the server's newly computed next episodes with stale client state.
  - Fixed Plex TMDB resolution: fixed a title search nesting bug in `fetchTmdbItemDetailsUncached` that caused non-IMDb Plex scrobbles to fail metadata lookup.
  - Added Creator TMDB Key resolution for Plex webhook handler (`handleMediaServerScrobble`).
  - Enhanced client-side episode watch status checks (`openEpisodeDetails`, `computeWatchBadgeState`) to support composite and title-based fallback IDs.

- **Fix:** Plex re-watch progression and TMDB API usage caching.
  - Added watch history reduction logic to Plex scrobbling (previously only on Nuvio) to accurately handle re-watching old episodes without accidentally reverting your Continue Watching state backwards.
  - Rewired TMDB requests to utilize Cloudflare's native Edge Cache API (`caches.default`) in addition to KV. External TMDB requests were bypassing edge caching on Cloudflare Free/Pro tiers, leading to intense TMDB rate-limiting (and inflated API usage stats in the admin dashboard) which previously caused Continue Watching updates to silently fail.

- **Fix:** Continue Watching next episode updates for Plex and Nuvio.
  - Fixed a string coercion bug when reducing watch history that caused the system to mistakenly fetch the next episode for the *first* watched episode rather than the *latest* one.
  - Added a fallback safety check: if a show's next episode cannot be fetched from TMDB (due to rate limits, server timeouts, or metadata agent mismatches from Plex), the previous Continue Watching state is now safely restored rather than permanently dropping the show.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-09-08

Closes the last open items from `AUDIT-2026-09-08-ADVERSARIAL-III.md`. Every finding in that report is now
either fixed or a recorded decision; nothing is deferred.

### ⚠️ Action required only if you are on the Workers **Free** plan

Three paths that used to exceed Cloudflare's 50-subrequest cap now work to a budget, and each budget is an
environment variable. Two default to the free-safe number and need nothing from anyone. The third,
`CRON_SUBREQUEST_BUDGET`, defaults to **10000** — the Paid number — because pacing it below one chart's worth
switches chart pre-warming *off* and drops the Continue Watching sweep to 8% of its throughput, which is a
feature going dark rather than a slower path to the same place.

**On a free Worker, set `CRON_SUBREQUEST_BUDGET` to `48`.** Dashboard deploys: your Worker → Settings →
Variables and Secrets → Add variable (type *Text*). You then get a tick that **completes** — Continue Watching
sweeping 12 shows every 6 minutes, which has never worked on a free Worker before — and no chart pre-warming,
because no free-plan budget can fit even one chart. Leave it unset on a free Worker and the tick is terminated
outright, exactly as it is today. **On a paid Worker, do nothing.** See README's "Which Cloudflare plan do I
need?".

### 🗑️ Removed

- **`POST /api/publish-list` is gone.** It was unauthenticated, minted a permanent unowned KV record on every
  call, had no caller anywhere in the shipped app, and was the easiest route to a stored payload. Everything
  that *reads* the records it already wrote is untouched: existing anonymous lists still serve at
  `/lists/user/<slug>`, still appear in the directory and in search, and are still browsable and deletable
  from `/admin`. Publishing a list now goes through the authenticated `/api/creator/lists/save`, which is
  owned and deletable by the person who made it.

### ⚡ Scale & cost

- **The directory index is 32 keys, not one.** Every public save, publish and like did a read-modify-write of
  a single key holding the whole directory — 4.45 MB at the 20,000-entry cap — against KV's limit of one
  write per second to a given key. Entries are now sharded across `index:publiclists:s0`…`s31` on a hash of
  the entry id, so a like touches ~1/32 of the blob and the deployment has 32 keys' worth of write throughput.
  A deployment upgrading in place keeps serving from the old key until its first full publish converts it, so
  the directory never serves a fraction of itself.
- **The daily rebuild actually runs now.** Staleness was read from the index blob's own timestamp, which every
  incremental write bumped — so a deployment busy enough to matter looked freshly built forever and never
  re-derived, which is exactly where stranded entries accumulate. It reads a small marker written only by a
  full build.
- **`/api/creator/lists` no longer ships every list's contents.** It returned each list's full `items` array
  on every dashboard render — after every save, delete and tab switch — measured at 15.08 MB for a 1,200-list
  account. It returns `itemCount` and `updatedAt`; the browser fetches the contents of only the lists whose
  version it does not already hold, from the new `POST /api/creator/lists/items`. After a one-list edit that
  is one list's items instead of all of them.
- **`/api/details/batch` fits an invocation.** 180 outbound fetches at its 60-id cap, against the free plan's
  50. It now spends a budget against *real* upstream calls, so a warm Airing Next refresh is still one
  request on either plan and only cold ids are metered; whatever it could not reach comes back as
  `remainingIds` and the client asks again.
- **The cron tick fits an invocation.** ~186 outbound fetches, so on a free Worker Cloudflare terminated it and
  Continue Watching never picked up a single episode. The episode sweep is now budgeted (two fetches per show,
  exactly) and runs *first*, so its work lands before the expensive optional half starts. Chart pre-warming
  rotates through the chart list from a cursor, and is skipped with one explanatory log line when the budget
  cannot fit even one chart — which is any free-plan budget, since one chart is ~105 fetches.
- Rate limits on `/api/details/batch` are charged in **ids**, not requests, so splitting one refresh across
  invocations does not quietly shrink the real ceiling. Same correction `/api/bulk-resolve` got in 1.5.2.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **A card's poster preview could go blank and stay blank.** Reported as "sometimes lists just doesn't load"
  on Discover's sub-nav tabs. Every list card's 9-poster strip is its own `/api/preview` call, up to 40 cards
  at once (5 concurrently, a mixed movie+show card costing two) — enough to occasionally catch its own per-IP
  rate limit or a single upstream timeout, and one failed call was treated as final: nothing rendered, nothing
  logged anywhere visible, and no way back short of a full page reload, since the render is cached once it
  completes and switching tabs away and back just replayed the same blank result. A failed preview now retries
  once automatically, which clears the common case silently; a card that still fails renders a plain
  "Couldn't load previews for this list" message with its own Retry button instead of staying blank.
- **Discover's sub-nav tabs get a header and a Refresh button.** Movies, Shows, Hidden Gems, Kids, Holidays and
  Genres had neither — Popular Lists and Curated, two pills over, had both. All six now show the same header
  shape with a title matching the pill and a Refresh button, which forces a real re-render rather than the
  cached one and so is also a manual way to clear the poster-preview failures above.
- **"KV put() limit exceeded for the day."** Marking a support thread done started failing on the live site,
  and the cause was nowhere near the admin panel: the two telemetry recorders were still on KV. Every tracked
  title cost **four** KV writes — a day-counts blob, a running total, a day index and a display blob — so a
  browser posting a ten-title batch spent 41 of the free plan's 1,000 writes a day, and roughly 250 watched
  titles exhausted the allowance for *everything*, admin actions included. A search cost three more. Counters
  moved to D1 where D1 is bound, which is the same move `bumpStat` made a while back and these two never
  followed. **No migration to run:** `stats` is keyed `(kind, day)` and its `kind` dimension was already
  unbounded, so `evt:{type}:{id}` and `searchq:{q}` go in beside the counters already there. A ten-title batch
  now costs one write per *newly seen* title and nothing at all on a repeat; a search costs nothing.
  - On the Trending and Search & Queries panels, a D1 deployment's numbers start from the switchover. The KV
    history stays under its existing TTL (120 days daily, 400 all-time) and is not merged in — merging would
    double-count every day both paths wrote.
  - Deployments with **no D1 bound are unchanged** and still read and write KV, with the two wasteful writes
    fixed there too: neither the day index nor the display blob is rewritten when its contents have not
    changed, and the display blob refreshes at most once a day per title (immediately if the title or media
    type actually changed). That is one KV read traded for one KV write, which on the free plan is 100 000
    reads a day against 1 000.
  - "Backfill Existing Data" follows the counters onto D1. Left on KV it would have run to completion, reported
    its title counts, and left the All Time board showing nothing.
- `/api/external-list/create` returned HTTP 500 and an internal error string when a body field was not a
  string. Fixed there and at the six sibling sites in the same file with the same shape.
- `/api/creator/reset-key` answered HTTP 200 on every failure. Throttles answer 429, credential failures 401 —
  with the message byte-identical across all of them, so the status codes say nothing the body did not.
- Removed `runListSearch()`, the one function in the client bundle with no reference of any kind.

### 📖 Documentation

- README: the three subrequest budgets and what each default costs; that the install link is a bearer
  credential carrying your provider tokens and Creator Key; that an admin session can only be revoked by
  rotating `ADMIN_KEY`; and that `POST /api/creator/sync/share-tracking` is supported but API-only.

### 🧪 Tests

464 pass, 1 skipped (up from 401). Twenty-three mutations — one per behaviour this release introduces — each
caught by the test written for it. Two test helpers were quietly not testing what they claimed: a cron tick was drained
with a single snapshot of `ctx.waitUntil`, so background work registered *by* that work was never awaited, and
the tests only passed because the pre-warm slept long enough between charts.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-31

### 🛠️ Sync & Live Preview Fixes
- **Watch Tracking Sync Debounce Accumulation**:
  - Fixed a race condition in `scheduleTrackingSync` where concurrent UI events wiped out the `intentionalRemoval` flag, causing unwatched episodes/seasons/shows and removed Continue Watching/Watch History items to revert after <1 second.
  - Ensured `toggleWatchStatus`, `toggleBatchWatchStatus`, and `dismissContinueWatchingShow` pass the intentional removal flag to permanently remove items in server KV.
- **Airing Next Multi-ID Deduplication**:
  - Captures canonical `tmdbId` to prevent the same upcoming episode from showing multiple times when Watch History stores mixed ID formats (`tt...`, `tmdb:...`).
- **Continue Watching Cross-Format Show Deduplication**:
  - Enhanced `dedupeContinueWatchingItems` to deduplicate shows across different ID formats using normalized show titles as a fallback.
- **Live Preview & Catalog Flashing Prevention**:
  - Added configuration payload hashing in `loadCreatorSync` to prevent tearing down the `#lists` DOM when only timestamps change during periodic background syncs.
  - Updated `renderLivePreview` to preserve existing posters during background data refreshes instead of clearing them out with shimmer skeletons.
- **Creator Sync Foreground Resume Crash Fix**:
  - Fixed runtime `ReferenceError: opts is not defined` crash in `loadCreatorSync`.
- **Large Account Performance Optimization**:
  - Removed 15-second forced full-page re-renders and stopped hidden tabs from generating thousands of image DOM nodes.
- **Continue Watching Badges & Parity Rules**:
  - Enforced complete mirroring between **Your Custom Lists > Continue Watching** and **Catalogs / Live Preview**:
    - **Newest Season**: Episode 1 displays `Season Premiere` (if unaired); middle episodes (2 to N-1) display `Finale: [Date]` (e.g. *Lanterns S01E02* `Finale: Oct 4`, *Reacher S04E02* `Finale: Sep 16`); final episode displays `Season Finale`. Unaired episodes display their upcoming air date badge.
    - **Older Seasons** (e.g. *Tracker S03E01*, *FBI S01E03*, *Reacher S03E01*): Displays no badges when the newest season is a later season.
  - Fixed `ReferenceError: today is not defined` in `isEpisodeAired` (`19_client-search-and-likes.js`) and resolved a syntax error in `22_client-creator-profile.js`.
  - Fixed poster card matching in `livePreviewPosterHtml` so Continue Watching badges in Catalogs / Live Preview mirror Your Custom Lists.
  - Enhanced `refreshAiringNext` to auto-fetch when local items are empty, preventing stalled schedule displays on startup.
  - Expanded server-side Airing Next evaluation limit (Trakt/Simkl/MDBList) from 35-40 up to 90 candidate shows, ensuring all upcoming episodes populate in Live Preview & Editor catalogs.
  - Fixed a massive HTTP 429 rate-limit bug when clicking "Mark all as Watched" on Trakt/Simkl/MDBList history, which previously attempted to redundantly sync thousands of items individually back to external providers.
  - Added an in-memory fallback for Custom Lists that completely bypasses the browser's 5MB `localStorage` limit for logged-in users, seamlessly syncing massive imported lists (8,000+ items) directly to/from the cloud. Offline/unauthenticated users now see a proper "Storage Full" error instead of a silent failure.
  - Added automated retry logic for Continue Watching updates during mass imports to prevent TMDB rate limits (110 of 111 shows failing), and fixed the "run this again" button so it actually retries fetching Continue Watching data even if the watch history is already imported.
  - Fixed a "Zombie" item bug where deleting a show from Continue Watching (or Watch History) and immediately refreshing the page would cause the item to re-appear due to Cloudflare KV propagation delays.
  - Fixed a bug where episodes scrobbled from external Media Servers (Plex, Emby, Jellyfin) would appear in Watch History but fail to show the "Marked as Watched" checkmark when browsing the show's seasons in the UI, and added backwards-compatibility so your existing scrobbles now display correctly.
  - Fixed a race condition where massive Trakt imports (8,000+ items) would vanish if the browser was refreshed immediately after importing, due to Cloudflare KV propagation delays overwriting the volatile RAM fallback; massive lists now correctly fallback to `sessionStorage` to safely survive page reloads.

- **TMDB Item Details & Badged Poster Click Fix**:
  - Fixed variable scope issue in server-side TMDB details handler that caused `/api/details` to return 404 for series.
  - Enhanced client-side poster click event delegation to ensure clicking anywhere on a badge or poster properly opens show details and cleans compound episode IDs.
- **Continue Watching "See All" Details View & Badge Enrichment**:
  - Fixed Continue Watching "See All" page to ensure it groups by show (displaying one card per in-progress show with the main Show Poster rather than raw episode still thumbnails).
  - Filtered out already-watched episodes from Watch History, corrected header button to "Clear All", and ensured unaired badges display cleanly alongside the red (X) remove button.
  - Enriched Continue Watching items (both dashboard shelf and "See All" page) to automatically display "Season Finale" (e.g. *Silo*) and "Finale: [Date]" (e.g. *Reacher*, *Lanterns*) badges for upcoming unaired episodes.
- **JavaScript Syntax Fix**:
  - Resolved `Uncaught SyntaxError` on client-side template string line breaks.
