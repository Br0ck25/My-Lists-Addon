# Frontend audit — fix status

Companion to [`AUDIT-2026-09-07-FRONTEND.md`](AUDIT-2026-09-07-FRONTEND.md),
which describes the frontend as it stood at `be20b1b`. That document is left as
the audit record and is not rewritten to match the fixes — except for one
correction, noted below, where the audit itself was wrong.

**Every finding in the original report is now fixed** — the ten ranked fixes
first, then the four below the line. Each was verified the same way twice: the
probe that demonstrated the defect now reports it gone, and the defect
reintroduced by mutation makes the suite fail. One finding found later, FE-17,
is fixed here too.

Suite: **315 tests, 314 passing, 1 skipped** (network-gated), up from 286/285.
`verify.sh` passes, including the byte-exact rebuild and three new steps.

option (b) of the two the finding sets out.

## What each fix actually changed

### FE-02 — the XSS, and why escaping was the delivery mechanism

`escapeAttr` is `escapeHtml`, which **emits** `&quot;`. Fifty-eight handler
sites delimited their JavaScript string with `&quot;`, and the HTML parser
decodes attribute entities before the JS parser runs — so the escaping
reconstituted the delimiter it was meant to neutralise.

`escapeJsAttr` escapes for both decodings in the order they happen: JS string
first, then HTML. `escapeAttr` is untouched and still correct for the `data-*`
and `title` attributes that use it — running the new one there would leave
visible backslashes.

Second layer: `dropUnsafeImportedIds` refuses ids that cannot have come from
this app (quote, angle bracket, backslash, control character — no slug, no
`ch_<time>_<rand>`, no `tt…` or `tmdb:…` contains one). It drops rather than
rewrites, because a catalog row references a channel *by key* and renaming one
would leave the row pointing at nothing. It runs inside
`validateAndRepairBackup` for the paste and upload paths, so it is reported the
way that function's other repairs are, and on both install-link paths, which
never went through it.

Verified surgical: a hostile channel in the same file as a good one drops the
hostile channel, keeps the good channel and the lists, and says which it
dropped and why.

**Side effect worth noting:** this also fixed a plain bug. A channel named
`O'Brien & Sons "Best"` produced `deleteLocalChannel("id", "O'Brien & Sons
"Best"")` — a syntax error, so its Delete button did nothing.

### FE-01 — the dead admin page, and the CI gap that let it ship

Seven escapes inside `renderAdminDashboard`'s template literal, which eats a
single backslash before the browser sees it. Four `\n` (a real newline inside a
single-quoted string — a `SyntaxError` that discarded all 60KB of the dashboard
script) and three `\s` (`/[\s,]+/` emitted as `/[s,]+/`, which splits slugs on
the letter *s* and is wrong quite independently of the syntax error).

The reason it shipped, twice — the second `confirm()` block arrived with
`4ba6e0a`, the previous audit's own fix commit — is that nothing ever rendered
this page. `verify.sh` step 4 does exactly the right thing for a page built from
a template literal, and only ever did it for the builder.

So `render_check.js` grew a `--admin` mode and `verify.sh` a step 4b. Confirmed
against the real defect: reintroducing one `\n\n` leaves `node --check` and the
builder-page check passing, exactly as they did in September, and fails the new
step.

### FE-03 — and why it is a D1 regression, not an old bug

Two clicks sent two `POST /api/creator/create`. Both succeeded and returned
different keys: KV is written unconditionally so it holds the last, D1's INSERT
violates the primary key on the second and is swallowed as non-fatal so it holds
the first, and reads prefer D1. The browser keeps whichever lands last.

Measured with the binding toggled and nothing else changed:

```
D1 bound   : over 5 double-creates -> first response's key valid 4/5
D1 UNbound : over 5 double-creates -> first response's key valid 0/5
```

KV-only, the last write won in the only store there was, so the key the browser
kept was always the valid one. The guard cost nothing to omit until D1 arrived.

`beginSubmit` keys the guard by name rather than holding it on the button,
because these modals rebuild their own markup and a disabled button does not
survive a re-render. Armed after form validation so a rejected form does not
latch it; released in a `finally` so a failed request does not either.

**Released early, deliberately.** The first version held the guard across
`loadCreatorSync`, which meant a slow sign-in left the Login button disabled for
the whole sync and blocked signing into a different account — found by the
FE-09 probe, which stopped being able to switch accounts. The guard exists to
stop a duplicate *request*, so it is released once the credential answer is in
hand.

Before: 6/6 double-clicks produced an account whose key 401s. After: 0/6, and
three rapid clicks send one request.

### FE-04 — reading the answer

All seven `item-mutate` call sites discarded the response and then reported
success. `externalMutateError` reads it once; each path recovers in the way it
honestly can:

- `removeSingleExternalItemDirect` no longer applies the change optimistically
  at all. It used to uncheck the box, drop the badge, hide the button and write
  the membership index before the request left. Doing that work *after* the
  answer is smaller than unwinding it, and the button already says
  "Removing…" in the meantime.
- The Add/Remove-from-Lists modal collects per-provider failures instead of
  throwing away `allSettled`'s results, and names them. The custom-list half is
  local and did land, so it is a partial result and says so.
- `removeListItemFromDetails` reports rather than reverts — the tile has already
  gone and putting it back afterwards reads worse than saying what happened.
- The three background mirror-writes keep the local change (it is the user's own
  edit) and surface which provider refused it.

The membership index is the important half: recording a removal that did not
happen hid the item from the next attempt.

### FE-05 / FE-09 / FE-07 / FE-06 — four shapes of the same mistake

Something asynchronous wrote to shared state without checking it was still the
thing that should be writing.

- **FE-05** `saveCreatorListEdit` cites `expectedUpdatedAt` and advances it from
  the reply. On 409 it does **not** retry: the remove-one-item paths can
  re-apply their change to whatever the other device saved because the change is
  a function of the list; this one is a whole replacement array from the
  builder, so only the person can choose. It pulls what is stored, says the list
  changed elsewhere, and leaves the draft alone.
- **FE-09** `loadCreatorSync` remembers who it is loading for and drops the
  answer if that changed.
- **FE-07** `likedLists` filtered to strings at both writers *and* at the read,
  so a browser already poisoned heals on next load rather than needing its site
  data cleared by hand.
- **FE-06** `runCatalogSearch` takes a sequence number, and
  `renderDefaultCatalogSearch` shares it — so clearing the box supersedes an
  in-flight search the way any other search would.

### FE-10 / FE-11 / FE-08 / FE-12 — the keyboard, and a lock that never locked

There was no `Escape` handler anywhere in the bundle. `showModal` now closes on
Escape, traps Tab, moves focus to the dialog's heading and returns it on close,
and carries `role="dialog"` / `aria-modal`. The four static dialogs in the page
shell never went through `showModal`, so they get the same three behaviours from
the outside rather than being rebuilt.

The scroll lock had never worked: `html { overflow-x: hidden }` gives the root
an explicit `overflow-y: auto`, and once `<html>` has its own overflow the
body's stops propagating to the viewport. With a modal open and
`body.style.overflow === 'hidden'`, a wheel event over the backdrop scrolled the
page 900px. `lockBackgroundScroll` locks the element that actually scrolls,
compensates for the scrollbar, restores position, and **counts** rather than
toggles so a dialog raised from a dialog does not unlock the page underneath.

Fixing that made FE-12 real rather than latent, so it is fixed in the same
commit: the select-list modal had four exits that disagreed, and one of them
would now have left a page that cannot be scrolled until reloaded.

Both nav bars became real tab widgets — `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`,
`aria-controls`, `role="tabpanel"`, `aria-labelledby`, roving `tabindex`, and
arrow/Home/End movement. The admin page's bar is a different case and got a
different answer: its three buttons do not reveal panels, they choose which row
of sub-tabs is shown, so it is a labelled group of `aria-pressed` toggle
buttons, which is what it is.

Also: every form control now has an accessible name (20 had none), and the
toast — how this app confirms nearly every action — is a polite live region.
The page had no live region at all.

---

## New CI checks

Three, all of which fail on the code as it stood.

1. **`verify.sh` step 4b / `ci.yml`** render `/admin` and syntax-check its inline
   scripts. This is the check whose absence let FE-01 ship.
2. **`html_checks.py`**: a `role="tablist"` must contain at least one
   `role="tab"`.
3. **`html_checks.py`**: every `aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby` /
   `aria-describedby` must resolve to an element that exists. This is what caught
   the admin page's empty tablist.

A fourth was written and then **removed**: a static accessible-name check. It
cannot see a control *wrapped* in a `<label>`, which is how most of this page
labels its checkboxes, so it reported 67 controls that a real DOM says are fine.
A check that is wrong 67 times is worse than no check; the browser probe answers
it correctly via `element.labels` and is committed alongside.

### Why the admin-page check in particular earns its place

The swallowed-backslash class is not a one-off. `git log` has it three times
before this audit:

```
7dea440  Fix See All overflow root cause + a backslash-escaping regression
c1e0829  ... the admin page's \n\n and /[\s,]+/          (FE-01, first half)
4ba6e0a  ... the second confirm() block                     (FE-01, second half)
```

It caught two more during this work: writing `.join('\n')` into
`19_client-search-and-likes.js` and a regex literal into
`24_client-backup-restore-presets.js`, both of which would have shipped broken
and both of which the checks failed on immediately.

That is the argument for the check rather than for care. Every one of these was
written by someone who knew the rule; the file is 35,000 lines of code living
inside a template literal, and the only reliable defence is a machine that reads
what the browser will actually receive.

---

## One correction to the audit itself

FE-11 originally claimed the six navigation items are announced twice because
both bars are in the DOM at once. **That is wrong**, and the report now says so
inline. Each bar is `display: none` at the other's breakpoint, which removes it
from the accessibility tree — measured after the fact: `bottom-nav` exposed at
390px, `tab-bar` at 1280px, one at a time. The empty-tablist half of the finding
stands.

(The report already carries one other correction, made during the audit: focus
visibility is fine. The first measurement used programmatic `.focus()`, which
does not trigger `:focus-visible`.)

---

## The last four

### FE-15 — the PWA now opens offline, and still cannot go stale

`sw.js` cached `/app.js?v=<hash>` and nothing else, so an offline reload was the
browser's error page — including for an installed `display: standalone` app,
which is the case the README was advertising.

Two caches, because the two kinds of thing have opposite needs.
`/app.js?v=<hash>` and `/app.css?v=<hash>` are content-addressed: a change gets
a different URL, so cache-first is safe by construction. The page is **not**
content-addressed — it is served `no-cache` with an ETag, and it is the thing
that *names* the current bundle hash. Cache-first on it would pin yesterday's
page, which names yesterday's bundle, and hold the whole app a deploy behind:
exactly the failure the versioned URLs exist to prevent. So the page is
network-first, and its cached copy is reached only when the network does not
answer.

Install warms the page so the *first* offline load works rather than only one
that follows an online visit. Activate drops caches outside the current set, so
the rename does not orphan `mylists-app-v1` on everyone's disk. Only the plain
`/` navigation is cached — a deep link renders per-request data that would be
wrong to replay later.

Measured, before and after:

```
before   OFFLINE reload: FAILED -> net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
after    OFFLINE reload: status 200
         {"tabs":12,"bundleRan":true,"cssApplied":"rgb(242, 242, 247)","visiblePanel":["discover"]}
         *** the app booted offline ***
```

And the property that had to survive, tested by injecting a changed page while
a cached one was present:

```
after activate   : [ 'mylists-shell-v2' ]          # mylists-app-v1 dropped
after a 'deploy' : "DEPLOYED-N-PLUS-1"             # not the cached copy
*** network-first holds: the new page wins over the cached one ***
```

**What this does and does not buy**, because the old README claim was the
problem: the app *opens* offline and its interface works. It does not *work*
offline — every API call still fails and the app shows the error states it
already had, and the fonts and the zip reader come from other origins that are
also unavailable. The README now says that rather than "offline caching".

`/sw.js` was also, until now, the one emitted script nothing ever parsed —
`node --check` on the combined Worker sees it as string content, exactly like
the admin page. A broken service worker is quieter than a broken page: it fails
to register and everything looks fine until offline stops working. So it is
hoisted to `SERVICE_WORKER_JS` at module scope, `render_check.js` grew a `--sw`
mode, and `verify.sh` a step 4c. Confirmed against a deliberate break: the
combined Worker still parses, and the new step points at the broken line.

### FE-13 — one reader for the saved dashboard order

Both sites did `JSON.parse` in a `try/catch` — which covers malformed JSON —
then tested `savedOrder && savedOrder.length` before `.map`. A string passes
that and throws, taking the whole dashboard render with it. Now one
`readDashboardListOrder()` that returns `[]` unless it really has an array, and
keeps only string entries. Four tests; reverting the guard fails two.

### FE-14 — six labels across 320px

`.bottom-nav-item` is `flex: 1` with `white-space: nowrap`, and a flex item's
default `min-width: auto` stops it shrinking below its own text — so at 320px
the sixth item ran to x=344 and rendered as "Settin". `min-width: 0` lets them
shrink, and a `max-width: 360px` rule brings the type down a step and the
letter-spacing to zero so the labels stay *readable* rather than merely
un-clipped. Measured after: Settings spans 267→320, `clipped: false`, and no
viewport from 320 to 1920 has horizontal scroll.

### FE-16 — the dead function

`renderCustomListSearchResults` (25 lines) deleted after re-confirming zero
references in the bundle, the rendered markup, the tests and the tooling. The
only other mention was the generated `FUNCTION-MAP.md`, which regenerates.

---

---

## FE-17 — the fifth stamp

`/api/creator/sync/meta` is the cheap poll a resumed browser makes before
deciding whether to reload anything. It returned four `updatedAt` stamps, read
straight out of the four sync blobs — and its own comment explains why they are
read from the real records rather than from a dedicated "last changed" key:

> a dedicated key would have to be updated by every write path that touches any
> of these blobs, and a single missed write there would silently stop a device
> from ever syncing again. Reading the real thing cannot drift.

That reasoning is sound and the hole was next to it: custom lists are not one of
those blobs. They are one record per list plus an order key, so there was
nothing for meta to read, and it answered "nothing changed" for an account whose
lists had just been rewritten elsewhere.

**Two options, and why this one.** Calling `/api/creator/lists` on every resume
would be smaller and drift-proof, but its version is a hash of the response
body, so the server reads and serialises every list to compute it — the saving
is the download, not the work. A fifth stamp keeps the poll genuinely cheap, at
the cost of being exactly the dedicated key that comment warned about. So the
warning is answered structurally rather than with care:

- `bumpCreatorListsStamp` (`02_http-and-creator-utils.js`) is the only writer.
- Six call sites bump it: `lists/save`, `lists/reorder`, `deleteCreatorLists`
  (shared by the user route and the admin one), the Watchlist write inside
  `sync/save-tracking`, `handleSubtitlesTrack`, and `purgeCreatorData` on a
  reset.
- A test walks the source, groups every mention of a `creatorlist:` /
  `creatorlistorder:` key by the route or function containing it, and fails if a
  block that mutates one lacks a bump — or if a block appears that is in neither
  the mutating nor the read-only list. Adding a seventh writer therefore breaks
  the build until someone classifies it.

That test earned itself immediately: it found `handleSubtitlesTrack`, which
takes a film off your Watchlist when you finish watching it. Nothing about it
reads like a list edit, and I had not counted it among the sites to bump.

**Details that only showed up in testing.**

- Account creation runs `purgeCreatorData` as a pre-create sweep, so an
  unconditional bump there handed every brand-new account a stamp describing a
  change that never happened. Gated on `listsCleared > 0`.
- A reset had to bump *after* the sweep, since `creatorliststamp:` is itself in
  the swept key set — and a stamp that went back to `0` would read as "nothing
  changed" to browsers still showing the lists it had just deleted.
- `creatorliststamp:` is in `purgeCreatorData`'s key list, so a deleted account
  cannot leave one behind for whoever registers that username next. That is the
  precise failure the key list's own comment exists to prevent.
- The stamp uses `nextSyncVersion`, so it strictly increases; the client
  compares with `>`, and two saves inside one millisecond must not tie.
- A reset sweeps `creatorliststamp:` away *before* re-bumping it, so the bump had
  nothing to count up from and produced a bare `Date.now()` — which ties with the
  previous stamp whenever the whole reset lands inside one millisecond, and a tie
  reads as "nothing changed". CI surfaced that as one red run against one green
  one; it was a real hole, not a flaky test. `bumpCreatorListsStamp` now takes a
  `notBefore` floor, and `purgeCreatorData` reads the stamp before the sweep so
  it can pass it. The test no longer depends on the clock either: it pins the
  stored stamp ahead of the wall clock, so the new one has to clear it whatever
  the timing.
- Deleting a list is why the stamp is written rather than derived: a
  `MAX(updated_at)` over the surviving `creator_lists` rows goes *down* when the
  newest list is the one removed. Reordering is the second reason — it touches
  only the order key, which has no D1 row at all.

**Client.** `handleForegroundResumeSync` compares the new stamp and, when only
the lists moved, refreshes just the dashboard instead of pulling the whole sync
blob. The stamp is adopted only after that refresh finishes, so a browser never
records itself level with a version it has not loaded. On the first poll after a
full load the stamp is unknown, which costs one conditional
`/api/creator/lists` — measured at **61 bytes** against a 2,636-byte full
payload for a 40-item list, answered `unchanged`.

**Measured, on the probes that found it** (`t46`/`t47`/`t48`, same rig):

```
                                      before          after
resume requests            /sync/meta only     /sync/meta + /lists
phone shows desktop's list           NO              YES
foreground 60s poll                  NO              YES
after 4 tab switches                 NO              (n/a, already current)
phone's own edit             409 + "This List      merges cleanly,
                              Changed Elsewhere"     no warning
desktop's films destroyed          none             none
```

The 409 path is not gone, only no longer routine — it is still what protects a
genuine simultaneous edit, and FE-05's guard is untouched.


## Regression tests added

Twenty-two, in `tests/client.test.mjs`, taking the client suite from 12 to 34.
Each was mutation-checked — the fix reverted, the test observed to fail, the fix
restored.

| Fix | Tests |
|---|---|
| FE-13 | a normal order passes through; a non-array returns nothing; non-slug entries are dropped; malformed JSON and a missing key survive |
| FE-02 | escaped handler parses to one call with one argument; ordinary ids pass through byte-identical; a name containing quotes survives (it used to be a syntax error); a hostile id is dropped at import while the rest of the file is kept |
| FE-03 | three clicks produce one request; the guard re-arms for a later attempt; a form rejected before any request does not latch it |
| FE-04 | a refusal raises the server's own message and leaves the membership index untouched; a real removal still confirms and records; a network failure is treated as a refusal |
| FE-05 | cites `expectedUpdatedAt`; cites nothing for a legacy record; does not retry over a 409 and keeps the draft; advances its baseline |
| FE-09 | a sync load for the previous account never reaches the DOM |
| FE-07 | non-string entries ignored on read; only strings stored on restore |
| FE-06 | the older response landing later does not replace the newer results |

The keyboard, focus, scroll-lock, layout and service-worker behaviours are
browser-level and are covered by the committed probes rather than by the `vm`
harness, which has no layout, no real focus model and no Cache Storage. `tests/client-harness.mjs` did need extending —
`lockBackgroundScroll` reads and restores the scroll position around every
modal, so the stub now has the viewport and scrolling properties every browser
has.
