## Order of work, and why it is that order

1. **T0 — the harness first.** Not a finding, a prerequisite. The regression tests
   for A2, A3, A5, A6 and A14 cannot be written at all against the old D1 mock: it
   hardcoded `SELECT * FROM creator_lists WHERE id = ?` to return no rows, it could
   never throw, and it could not enforce a constraint. Fixing the code before the
   harness would mean landing five fixes nothing can prove.
2. **A1** — the only finding an unauthenticated stranger can trigger, and it destroys
   other people's data. Nothing else outranks it.
3. **A5, then A3 + A4 together** — the three `ok:true`-while-doing-nothing defects, in
   decreasing order of how bad the lie is: a leaked key that still works > a deleted
   account that still works > a deleted account whose data is inherited by a stranger.
   A3 and A4 landed in one commit rather than two: both are `purgeCreatorData`
   reporting success after failing, and splitting them would have left that one
   function half-converted between commits.
4. **A2 + A6** — one commit, because they are one root cause (D1 preferred on read over
   the store that is actually authoritative). Fixing A2's `likes` binding without
   fixing the read preference would leave A6 live and A2 reachable by another route.
5. **P2 batch** — real defects, none of which silently destroys data.
6. **P3 batch** — hygiene, accuracy and documentation.

## Status

### Prerequisite

| | Finding | Severity | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T0** | Test harness cannot see D1 (§9 blind spots) | — | ✅ | `tests/harness.mjs` |

### P0 — silent data destruction and false success

| | Finding | Severity | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** | Cross-account D1 delete via SQL `LIKE` wildcard | CRITICAL | ✅ | `02_…:2206` → `WHERE username = ?`; `escapeLikePrefix` for `03_…:1133` |
| **A5** | Key rotation reports success while rotating nothing | HIGH | ✅ | `rotateCreatorKeyHashInD1` (02_); both rotation routes; migrate-d1 `DO UPDATE` |
| **A3** | `delete-account` `ok:true`, account still authenticates | HIGH | ✅ | `purgeCreatorData` identity: D1 before KV, abort on failure |
| **A4** | Failed purge frees the username while data survives | HIGH | ✅ | `purgeCreatorData` returns `ok`; both callers 500 on failure |

### P1 — the structural cause

| | Finding | Severity | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A2** | Ordinary edit zeroes a real like count in D1 then KV | HIGH | ✅ | `likes` bound on both INSERTs; KV-first reads |
| **A6** | Dropped D1 write diverges the dashboard permanently | MED-HIGH | ✅ | `getCreator`/`getCreatorList` read KV first, D1 as fallback |

### P2 — real defects, no silent data loss

| | Finding | Severity | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A7** | In-flight rebuild re-publishes a list just made private | MEDIUM | ✅ | removals recorded + re-verified before the rebuild publishes |
| **A8** | Unpublish `ok:true` while the index removal fails silently | MEDIUM | ✅ | removal is awaited and reported; adding stays fire-and-forget |
| **A9** | Conflict guard: same-ms bypass + fails open on a non-number | MEDIUM | ✅ | `parseExpectedUpdatedAt` + `nextSyncVersion` (02_) |
| **A10** | Presets/channels/tracking unguarded; watchlist has no merge | MEDIUM | ✅ | guards on save-presets/save-channels + client; watchlist empty-guard |
| **A11** | No size bound on the authenticated list write | MEDIUM | ✅ | `CREATOR_LIST_BYTES_MAX` + shared item/name caps |
| **A12** | `json()` cacheable default; admin 401s cached for an hour | MEDIUM | ✅ | errors (incl. `ok:false` 200s) → `no-store`; explicit on credential routes |
| **A13** | No global exception boundary | MEDIUM | ✅ | `export default.fetch` try/catch; two unguarded `res.json()` wrapped |
| **A15** | `schema.sql` vs migrations index drift | LOW | ✅ | index added; a test diffs both provisioning paths |

### P3 — hygiene, accuracy, documentation

| | Finding | Severity | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A14** | migrate-d1 cannot repair a stale row; counters count attempts | LOW-MED | ✅ | `DO UPDATE` (with A5) + `meta.changes` counters + a `skipped` tally |
| **A16** | Counters are D1-only once bound, vs the "removable" promise | LOW | ✅ | documented in `wrangler.toml` + `bumpStat`; behaviour deliberately kept |
| **A17** | Cron cursor advances before the work is done | LOW | ✅ | cursor committed after the batch |
| **A18** | Daily seed rolls at UTC midnight, stats at Eastern midnight | LOW | ✅ | `getDailySeed` uses `easternDateKey` |
| **A19** | Unbounded, unvalidated `lists/reorder` array | LOW | ✅ | `CREATOR_LIST_ORDER_MAX`, per-slug length, no `:` |
| **A20** | FK blocks list writes for a not-yet-migrated account | LOW-MED | ✅ | `backfillCreatorRowInD1` + one retry, on the failure path only |
| — | `CHECK (visibility IN …)` hardening | — | ⏸️ | **deliberately not done** — see below |
| — | Stale comments (§16 F1/F2/F3) | — | ✅ | F1/F2 corrected in code; F3 is in a historical audit, left as written |

---

## Deliberately not done

**`CHECK (visibility IN ('public','private'))` on `creator_lists`.** SQLite cannot add
a constraint to an existing table without rebuilding it, so this could only go into
`schema.sql` — which would make a *fresh* database a different shape from a *migrated*
one, i.e. exactly the drift A15 just closed and now has a test forbidding. Doing it
properly means a table-rebuild migration against live data, and the value is small:
`normalizeListVisibility` already fails closed on every write and
`isPublicListVisibility` fails closed on every read, so nothing in the app can produce
a value the constraint would catch. Recorded rather than done, with the reasoning, so
the next person does not re-derive it.

## Mutation testing, re-run against the fixed code

The audit's headline test-suite finding was that 7 of 12 controlled bugs survived the
suite. Re-run after the P0/P1 fixes, with two new mutations aimed at the fixes
themselves:

**All twelve are now killed**, plus two new ones aimed at the fixes themselves.

| Mutation | Audit | Now |
|---|---|---|
| skip the D1 write in `lists/save` entirely | **survived** | killed |
| `/api/lists/like` writes `0` to D1 instead of the real count | **survived** | killed |
| account purge widened to every list row in the database | **survived** | killed |
| `listAllKeys` stops following the cursor after page 1 | **survived** | killed |
| index-rebuild prefix `publishedlist:user:` → `publishedlist:usr:` | **survived** | killed |
| `pickFreeSlug` returns a taken slug when it runs out | **survived** | killed |
| `PUBLISHED_LIST_ITEMS_MAX` off by one | **survived** | killed |
| `authenticateCreator` accepts a wrong key | killed | killed |
| `isPublicListVisibility` inverted | killed | killed |
| skip the KV write in `lists/save` | killed | killed |
| remove the 409 conflict check | killed | killed |
| `removeListsFromPublicIndex` becomes a no-op | killed | killed |
| *new:* rotation swallows an unrecoverable D1 failure and reports success | — | killed |
| *new:* `purgeCreatorData` always returns `ok: true` | — | killed |

`pickFreeSlug`'s is worth a note. Driving it through the API cannot reach the exhausted
branch — the random-suffix attempts essentially never collide, so it returns on the
first one every time — so that mutation survived an end-to-end test and is killed by a
direct test of the contract it documents instead. A mutation surviving is not always a
coverage hole; sometimes it means the mutated path is unreachable, and the honest answer
is to test the contract rather than contort a scenario.

## Verification against the audit's own reproductions

Re-run from `audit/adversarial-2026-09-06/` against the fixed tree:

| Check | Audit | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `t20_faultinject.mjs` — 120 random ops, D1 failing 15% and 40% | **5 of 6 seeds diverged** | **all 6 consistent** |
| `t19_stateful.mjs` — 10 seeds × 120 ops, model-checked after every op | clean | still clean |
| `t07_differential.mjs` — KV-only vs KV+D1 | 0 differences | 0 differences |
| `t01` cross-account delete | victim's rows destroyed | victim's row and like count intact |
| `t03` likes after an edit | 5 → 0 in both stores | 5 throughout |
| `t06` rotation with D1 failing | old key lives, new key dead | old key dead, new key works |
| `t17` unpublish during a rebuild | re-published to directory + search | stays unpublished |
| `t21`/`t22` failed deletes | `ok:true`, data inherited by a stranger | `ok:false`, nothing removed, name not reclaimable |

`m6` (KV pagination cursor), `m7` (index-rebuild prefix), `m10` (slug fallback) and
`m11` (cap off-by-one) were still open when this line was first written; they belonged
to the P2 batch, which has since landed. All four are killed — see the mutation table
above, and the four tests that kill them: `listAllKeys follows the cursor past the first
page`, the rebuild-prefix assertion, `pickFreeSlug returns empty rather than a taken slug
when it runs out`, and the item-cap boundary test.

## Gate for every commit

`bash verify.sh` must pass: rebuild is byte-exact, `node --check` clean, the rendered
builder page validates, `FUNCTION-MAP.md` is current, and the whole suite is green.
Each fix also ships the regression test named for it in §13 of the audit, and that test
is confirmed to **fail against the pre-fix code** before the fix is applied.
