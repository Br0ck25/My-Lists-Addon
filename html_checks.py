# only if those handlers actually resolve: a typo'd or deleted function is a
# ReferenceError the moment someone clicks it, and nothing else in this
# pipeline would notice -- node --check sees the page as a string, and the
# inner-script parse above only proves the bundle PARSES.
#
# Matching has to be careful or it is worse than useless. Two things produce
# false positives: method calls (something.getElementById(...)), and ordinary
# prose inside string arguments -- onclick="addRow('Streaming (All
# Services)', ...)" is not a call to Streaming(). So string literals are
# blanked first, and only bare identifiers count as calls.
