# Verifies that worker_entry_combined.js is exactly what build.py produces.
#
# This used to check something much weaker: that each numbered source file
# appeared SOMEWHERE inside the combined file. That passes on a combined file
# with the modules in the wrong order, with a module duplicated, or with extra
# content appended after the last one -- none of which build.py can produce, so
# the check could only ever agree with a build that had already gone right.
#
# verify.sh and CI never used it; both rebuild and diff, which is the real
# check. Rather than leave a weaker duplicate around to be trusted by mistake,
# this now does the same thing they do, and can be run on its own:
#
# "The same thing they do" includes ignoring line endings, which this did not.
# Both of those compare with `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol`; this compared raw
# bytes. worker_entry_combined.js used to be committed CRLF while the numbered
# sources were LF, so on a clean checkout the byte compare always failed -- and
# told you to run build.py, which would have committed 3.3MB of line-ending
# churn (CI, ignoring CR at EOL, would not have objected) and flipped the file
# straight back for the next person on the other platform.
#
# That split is now fixed at the root: .gitattributes pins the whole repository
# to LF, including the working tree, so the build is reproducible on any
# platform and this compare is byte-exact in practice. The normalisation below
# is kept anyway -- it costs nothing, and it means a checkout that somehow
# gains CRLF still reports only real mismatches instead of every line:
#
#   python3 check_sync.py
#
# Exits non-zero, and says where the first difference is, if the committed
# Worker is not byte-for-byte what the sources build to.
